# RAIC (Resonance-Aware Inference Controller) Demo Configuration
# Synthetic covariance generation and batch evaluation settings

# Controller parameters
controller:
  window_size: 20              # Rolling window for λ_max statistics
  threshold_sigma: 2.0         # Alarm threshold: mean + k*σ
  intervention_mode: temperature  # temperature, top_k, prompt, hybrid
  baseline_temperature: 0.7    # Default sampling temperature
  min_temperature: 0.3         # Lower bound during intervention
  max_temperature: 1.0         # Upper bound (rarely used)

# Synthetic data generation
synthetic:
  n_steps: 100                 # Number of time steps
  dim: 6                       # Covariance matrix dimensionality
  seed: 42                     # Random seed for reproducibility
  instability_interval: [30, 50]  # Steps where λ_max is amplified
