# Retrospective

> *“Geometry writes energy. Energy sculpts geometry. Intelligence emerges from their dance.”*

This page summarizes where Resonance Geometry started, what we built, and why the results matter.

## Highlights

- **From intuition to equation:** A Lagrangian tying resonance, curvature, and instability:
  \[
  \mathcal{L} = \tfrac{1}{2}\dot{\Phi}^2 - \tfrac{\omega_0^2}{2}\Phi^2 + \alpha R(\Phi) - \beta \lambda(\Phi)^2
  \]
- **Convergent evidence at \(\beta_c \approx 0.015\):**
  - Ringing detector (phenomenology)
  - Jacobian eigenvalues (mechanism)
  - Fluency velocity \(v_f\) (energy flow)
- **Living laboratory:** Reproducible simulators, sweeps, dashboards, CI, and dissertation chapters.

## Read the Full Chapter

- **Dissertation chapter:** [`docs/dissertation/04_retrospective.md`](../docs/dissertation/04_retrospective.md)  
- **Abstract:** [`docs/dissertation/04_retrospective_abstract.md`](../docs/dissertation/04_retrospective_abstract.md)

## Key Artifacts

- Dashboard status: [`docs/data/status/summary.json`](../docs/data/status/summary.json)  
- Ringing sweep: `results/ringing_sweep/` → figures in `docs/assets/figures/`  
- Jacobian sweep: `results/jacobian_sweep/` → boundary/eigen plots  
- Fluency probes: `results/fluency_sweep/` (if present)
