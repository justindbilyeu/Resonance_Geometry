# Topological Constraint

## Full Protocol
1. Seven locked specifications define stimuli, timing, participant state, signal processing, and response capture.
2. Thresholds are calibrated at coefficient of determination \(R^2 \geq 0.90\) for model-to-data fits.
3. Curvature criteria require \(\kappa < -0.1\) within the designated manifold sectors.
4. Control sessions mirror active runs with randomized phase to test specificity.
5. Preprocessing pipelines are frozen ahead of data collection and versioned in our repo.
6. Blind analysis ensures experimenters cannot tune thresholds after seeing outcomes.
7. Replication-ready scripts are staged for independent labs prior to unblinding.

Either the substrate holds forbidden regions or the metaphor dissolves. Both results refine the theory.

**“This is our gravitational lensing. Either the forbidden regions exist, or they don’t. Either way, the experiment decides.”**
