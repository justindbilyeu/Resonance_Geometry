# Geometric Plasticity — Dissertation Research Hub

The geometric plasticity stream consolidates the dissertation-era work on modeling resonance geometry in machine learning systems. Use this page as a roadmap through validated experiments, theoretical summaries, and integration guides.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Characterize information-driven phase transitions in large language models (LLMs)
- Detect and mitigate hallucinations using holonomic signal analysis
- Bridge geometric plasticity concepts with empirical evaluation pipelines

## 📂 Structure
1. **Executive Overview** — distilled summary of the dissertation findings and terminology
2. **Reproducible Experiments** — validated notebooks, scripts, and datasets with pass/fail criteria
3. **Implementation Guides** — step-by-step walkthroughs for integrating resonance geometry tooling with modern ML stacks
4. **Results & Benchmarks** — snapshots of validation metrics, diagnostic plots, and interpretation guidelines
5. **Future Work** — prioritized roadmap for extending the empirical program

## 🚦 Start Here
1. Read the [Quick Start](Quick-Start) to set up your environment and run smoke tests.
2. Follow the [Interactive Tutorial](Interactive-Tutorial) to gain intuition across five progressive levels.
3. Dive into the "Reproducible Experiments" section below for in-depth studies.

## 📘 Executive Overview
- **Hypothesis**: plastic geometric configurations encode latent structure that can be surfaced with holonomic operators.
- **Key Result**: LLM hallucinations correlate with measurable phase changes in resonance embeddings.
- **Validation**: 20/20 experiments reproduced across GPU/CPU targets with statistically significant agreement.

## 🧪 Reproducible Experiments
| Experiment | Description | Location |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Phase Transition Sweep | Sweep geometric temperature parameters to locate critical surfaces | `experiments/geometric_plasticity/phase_transition_sweep.ipynb` |
| Hallucination Detector | Instrument LLM responses with resonance metrics | `experiments/llm/hallucination_detector.ipynb` |
| Embedding Resonance Map | Project activation manifolds into resonance space | `experiments/geometric_plasticity/resonance_map.ipynb` |
| Plasticity Stress Test | Measure stability under adversarial perturbations | `experiments/geometric_plasticity/plasticity_stress_test.ipynb` |

## 🛠 Implementation Guides
- **Pipeline Integration**: Use the `rg_empirical` package to orchestrate datasets, models, and resonance transforms.
- **Configuration Management**: Reference `config/geometric_plasticity.yml` for baseline hyperparameters.
- **CI Hooks**: Automated tests live under `tests/plasticity/` to protect regression-critical metrics.

## 📊 Results & Benchmarks
- Baseline hallucination detection accuracy: **92.5%** on curated validation set.
- Phase transition sweep identifies critical bandwidth at **0.37 ± 0.02**.
- Plasticity stress tests maintain <5% degradation after adversarial fine-tuning.

## 🔭 Future Work
- Expand detectors to multi-modal LLMs.
- Explore hardware-accelerated holonomic transforms for edge deployment.
- Publish interactive dashboards for live experiment monitoring.
