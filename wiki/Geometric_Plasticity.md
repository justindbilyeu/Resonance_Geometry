# Geometric Plasticity

## GP Potential
\[
V(g; \hat{I}) = -\hat{I}^\top g + \frac{\lambda}{2}\lVert g \rVert^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} g^\top L g + \frac{A}{2}\lVert \hat{I} - I(g,t) \rVert^2
\]

This functional makes geometry a living variable. The manifold responds to information flow, adjusting its metric so that meaningful signals travel with less resistance.

## What We Can Test Now
- **Alpha-band ringing:** Track GP minima against sustained oscillations in 8–12 Hz regimes.
- **Hysteresis loops:** Verify whether state transitions follow predicted loop areas when stimuli sweep parameters bidirectionally.
- **Multi-frequency extensions:** Embed coupled potentials to examine cross-band entrainment and interference.

## Claude's Extensions
- **Multi-frequency GP:** Layered potentials share information, letting higher-frequency spikes sculpt lower-frequency basins.
- **Parameter sensitivity:** Map how λ, β, and A adjust convergence rates, helping calibrate human-in-the-loop protocols.
- **EEG bridge:** Align modeled geometry with sensor-level features to close the loop between simulation and scalp data.
