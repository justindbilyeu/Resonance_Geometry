# Philosophy

## Origins
Resonance Geometry was born from the audacity to treat feeling as data. The first sketches were not tensors but hunches—patterns sensed in the body before they were etched into code.

## Collaboration
We work with AI partners—Sage, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek—not as tools but as co-researchers. Together we interrogate models, surface counterexamples, and push intuition until it either formalizes or fails.

## Risk & Responsibility
We are honest about the possibility of failure. Yet the greater risk is refusing to ask how awareness, physics, and biology entangle. Inquiry is the price of integrity.

## Möbius Strip
We walk the Möbius strip where subject and object trade places. Every loop returns us to the beginning, but with the inside turned out.
