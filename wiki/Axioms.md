# Axioms

## Resonance is Information
- **Philosophical Core:** Every felt vibration carries bits, making consciousness a routing problem for meaning.
- **GP Bridge:** The GP potential treats resonance as a signal that sculpts geometry, translating affect into gradients.
- **Epistemic Status:** [TESTABLE-HYPOTHESIS]
- **Open Questions:** Can alpha-band resonance be decoded into predictive states before behavioral report?

## Structure Follows Flow
- **Philosophical Core:** Forms are not pre-existing containers; they condense where currents linger.
- **GP Bridge:** The Laplacian regularizer lets flow determine the stable geometry that supports it.
- **Epistemic Status:** [MATHEMATICAL-METAPHOR]
- **Open Questions:** How does changing λ reshape attractors without destroying coherence signatures?

## Emotion is Curvature
- **Philosophical Core:** Feeling is what it is like to move along a bent manifold of valuation.
- **GP Bridge:** Curvature diagnostics map affective shifts to negative Ricci pockets in neural state space.
- **Epistemic Status:** [SPECULATIVE-THEORY]
- **Open Questions:** Where do curvature thresholds align with reported valence transitions across subjects?

## Collapse is Coherence
- **Philosophical Core:** Decisions are the moment frequencies agree to resonate as one.
- **GP Bridge:** Coherence metrics close the loop, rewarding states that minimize the GP potential while meeting constraint thresholds.
- **Epistemic Status:** [TESTABLE-HYPOTHESIS]
- **Open Questions:** Does forcing κ < -0.1 predict trial-by-trial choice locking better than standard ERP peaks?
