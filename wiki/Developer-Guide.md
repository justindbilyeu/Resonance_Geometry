# Developer Guide ‚Äî Contributing to Resonance Geometry

This guide explains how to collaborate effectively on Resonance Geometry across both research streams. It covers environment setup, coding standards, documentation expectations, and review workflows.

## üß≠ Repository Layout
- `src/` ‚Äî core resonance geometry libraries shared by both streams
- `rg_empirical/` ‚Äî runnable pipelines, datasets, and experiment orchestration
- `experiments/` ‚Äî curated notebooks and scripts grouped by research theme
- `docs/` ‚Äî formal documentation, including the dissertation artifacts
- `wiki/` ‚Äî GitHub wiki source files mirrored in this repository

## üõ† Environment Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   pip install -e .
   ```
2. Configure pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. (Optional) Enable CUDA acceleration by installing the appropriate PyTorch build.

## üìê Coding Standards
- Follow the formatting enforced by `ruff` and `black` (run `make lint`).
- Prefer functional decomposition with clear docstrings describing resonance-specific terminology.
- Avoid introducing try/except blocks around imports (per project guidelines).
- Write deterministic tests using fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` when possible.

## ‚úÖ Testing Matrix
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pytest` | Run the full unit/integration suite |
| `make lint` | Execute static analysis (`ruff`, `black`, `mypy` when configured) |
| `make docs` | Build documentation and ensure Sphinx configuration passes |
| `python -m rg_empirical.run --config <file>` | Launch experiment workflows for manual validation |

## üßæ Documentation Workflow
- Update the relevant wiki page when introducing new experiments or metrics.
- Keep changelog entries synchronized with `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Use the stream tags (`[Holonomic Memory]`, `[Geometric Plasticity]`) in pull request titles for clarity.

## üîÑ Review Process
1. Open a descriptive issue or discussion thread for significant changes.
2. Submit a pull request referencing the issue and include:
   - Summary of modifications
   - Test evidence
   - Impact on both research streams (if applicable)
3. Request review from maintainers listed in `CODEOWNERS`.
4. Address feedback promptly; keep discussions focused and respectful.

## ü§ù Community Standards
- Adhere to the project [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Share reproducible artifacts (configs, seeds, datasets) when reporting results.
- Celebrate cross-stream collaboration‚Äîinsights from one stream often inform the other.
