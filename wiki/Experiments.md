# Experiments

## Topological Constraint Test
Our eclipse moment. See the full protocol in [Topological Constraint](Topological_Constraint.md).

## Spin Foam Optimization
Grok's optimized Monte Carlo engine meets our surrogate models to explore discrete-to-continuum transitions with fewer samples.

## Resonance Mapper
A graph neural network fused with topological data analysis unifies simulations and empirical data into a shared latent atlas.

## Ricci Curvature & Fractal Boundaries
We track how curvature and fractality co-vary, revealing where awareness pushes systems toward the edge of chaos.

_All experiments are preregistered with locked criteria._
