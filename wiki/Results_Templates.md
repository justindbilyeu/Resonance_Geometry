# Results Templates

## Outcome Paragraphs
- **Strong Effect:** “Data exceeded preregistered thresholds across curvature, resonance locking, and behavioral coherence. The GP potential converged within 2.5 iterations on average, signaling substrate-level support for the hypothesis.”
- **Moderate Effect:** “Findings crossed curvature thresholds but coherence lagged. The topology hints at constraint zones, yet additional sampling is required to confirm stability.”
- **Weak Effect:** “Signals flirted with the forbidden boundary but failed to maintain κ < -0.1. The metaphor survives, the substrate remains unproven.”
- **Null Effect:** “No registered deviation from control manifolds. Resonance Geometry remains a poetic conjecture awaiting a firmer anchor.”

## EEG Bridge Methods
“EEG data were filtered into canonical bands, transformed via Resonance Mapper embeddings, and matched to simulated trajectories. Alignment quality was quantified with cross-frequency coherence and GP residuals.”
