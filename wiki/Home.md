# Resonance Geometry Research Router

Welcome to the Resonance Geometry knowledge base. Choose the research stream that best matches your goals and dive into curated guides, tutorials, and background material.

---

## ðŸŒŒ Stream 1 â€” Holonomic Memory
- **Primary focus**: cosmological redshift as holonomy, biological coherence, water structuring, and consciousness research
- **Entry point**: [Holonomic Memory Home](Holonomic-Memory-Home)
- **Ideal for**: researchers exploring theoretical foundations and interdisciplinary physics/biology connections
- **What you will find**: archived wiki content, conceptual frameworks, experimental proposals, and bibliographies that motivated the original project direction

---

## ðŸ§  Stream 2 â€” Geometric Plasticity
- **Primary focus**: dissertation work on information-driven phase transitions, LLM hallucination detection, and neural network dynamics
- **Entry point**: [Dissertation Home](Dissertation-Home)
- **Ideal for**: engineers, ML practitioners, and neuroscientists interested in empirical tooling and reproducible experiments
- **What you will find**: implementation notes, validation results, tutorials, and pipelines aligned with the recent dissertation research

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Access
- [Quick Start](Quick-Start) â€” run a minimal Resonance Geometry experiment in 15 minutes
- [Interactive Tutorial](Interactive-Tutorial) â€” progress through five levels of hands-on learning
- [Developer Guide](Developer-Guide) â€” contribute code, documentation, and experiments responsibly

## ðŸ”„ Maintaining Continuity
All legacy Holonomic Memory material has been preserved at [Holonomic Memory Home](Holonomic-Memory-Home). New geometric plasticity resources are tracked independently to keep both threads discoverable while still sharing tooling and terminology.

If you are unsure where to begin, skim the [Quick Start](Quick-Start) for a fast overview, then follow the stream-specific recommendations above.
