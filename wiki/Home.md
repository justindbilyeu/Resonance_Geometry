# Resonance Geometry Initiative

## What This Is
Resonance Geometry did not begin as an equation. It began as a feeling. The project traces the same arc that carried Kekulé from dream to benzene ring and Einstein from thought experiment to gravitational curvature. We let intuition bloom first, hold it long enough to sense its contour, then transcribe it into mathematics. Each cycle returns us to the lab, to iteration, to the discipline that turns metaphor into models.

## Why It Matters
This is not merely a meditation on consciousness. It is an attempt to name the unnamed patterns threading physics, biology, and awareness into one fabric. When resonance becomes geometry we can track how meaning stabilizes, how perception bends space, how agency leaves measurable fingerprints.

## Our 1919 Eclipse
Our decisive experiment is the Topological Constraint Test. It is our eclipse expedition, searching for the deflection of attention the way Eddington searched for light bending. The locked protocol lets the data choose between worlds: either the constraint is real, or it dissolves the metaphor.
