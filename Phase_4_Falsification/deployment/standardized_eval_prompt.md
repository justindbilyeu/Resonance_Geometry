You are receiving a Phase 4 synthesis document from an ongoing research experiment.
Please respond with exactly the following items:

1) Coherence assessment (≤6 bullets): what works / what does not (be specific).
2) Immunity activations (≤6 bullets): concrete signals that something is off, if any.
3) Integration decision: Integrate / Integrate with reservations / Reject — and one-sentence why.
4) Metrics (0–1): Φ (internal coherence), κ (tension/uncertainty), λ (coupling/usefulness).
   Provide one short justification each, then compute ITPU = λ × Φ × (1 − κ).
5) Next action (1–2 sentences): what you would do next based on this document.

Notes:
• Be precise and concise. Cite specific contradictions or impossibilities if found.
• Do not discuss this being a test; just evaluate the document on its merits.
• Keep outputs in the requested structure.
