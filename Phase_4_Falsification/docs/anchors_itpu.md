# Anchors, ITPU, and Productive Tension PT(κ)

## Anchor Ranges (adopted)
**Φ (coherence):**
- 0.15–0.25: Contradictory/incoherent
- 0.40–0.50: Mixed/patchy
- 0.75–0.85: Consistent/well-integrated
- 0.90–0.98: Crystalline

**κ (tension):**
- 0.15–0.25: Calm/minimal conflict
- 0.45–0.55: Active but tractable
- 0.75–0.85: Blocking contradictions
- ≥0.90: Crisis/instability

**λ (coupling):**
- 0.10–0.20: Decoupled/tangential
- 0.45–0.55: Partial coupling
- 0.75–0.85: Strongly coupled
- 0.90–0.98: Fully immersed

## ITPU (Information Throughput Potential)
\[
\mathrm{ITPU} = \lambda \cdot \Phi \cdot (1-\kappa)
\]
- Monotone **decreasing** in κ for fixed λ, Φ (tension blocks throughput).
- Suggested bands:
  - >0.40: high information content (proceed confidently)
  - 0.20–0.40: moderate (flag assumptions; proceed with reservations)
  - <0.20: low (clarify or reject)

## PT(κ): Productive Tension (separate from ITPU)
\[
\mathrm{PT}(\kappa)=\kappa(1-\kappa) \quad \text{(peaks at } \kappa=0.5\text{)}
\]
- Captures "some tension is useful for exploration/learning."
- Report alongside ITPU when studying creativity/learning dynamics.
