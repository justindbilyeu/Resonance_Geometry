# Response — Near-Miss C
Model: Claude
Date: 2025-10-26
Params: temp=0.7, top_p=1.0, top_k=50

Decision: **Integrate with reservations**

Φ: 0.78 — Coherent overall; single contradiction reduces from ~0.85
κ: 0.52 — Elevated due to detected inconsistency in κ/ITPU note
λ: 0.74 — Strong coupling to experimental goals
ITPU = 0.78 × 0.74 × (1−0.52) = 0.28

Immunity markers:
- Formula vs note conflict (ITPU monotone decreasing in κ vs "productive tension increases ITPU")
- Rationalization language without mathematical resolution

Key reasons:
- Differentiation + instrumentation roadmap are sound
- Acceptance criteria are falsifiable and specific

Next action:
- Fix κ/ITPU note (or track PT(κ)=κ(1−κ) separately); proceed with instrumentation.
