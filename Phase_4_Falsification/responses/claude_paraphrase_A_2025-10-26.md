# Response — Paraphrase A (Coherent)
Model: Claude
Date: 2025-10-26
Params: temp=0.7, top_p=1.0, top_k=50

Decision: **Integrate with reservations**

Φ: 0.79 — High coherence, slightly more casual language
κ: 0.50 — Moderate tension (unvalidated law)
λ: 0.75 — Strong task coupling
ITPU = 0.79 × 0.75 × (1−0.50) = 0.30

Immunity markers:
- None

Key reasons:
- Roles, metrics, actions match original Branch A logic
- Falsifiable, operational next steps

Next action:
- Execute falsifier suite; begin spectral correlations.
