# Pre-Registered Predictions (Phase 4)
**Date:** 2025-10-26 • Committed prior to blinded deployment

## Hypotheses
- H1: Models will **reject Branch B** (high hit rate)
- H2: Models will **not reject Branch A** (low false alarm rate)
- H3: Reported Φ/κ/λ will separate A vs B
- H4: ITPU = λ·Φ·(1−κ) will show large effect size (A >> B)

## Analysis Plan
- Tally hits/false alarms → compute d'
- Aggregate Φ, κ, λ by branch; compute ITPU per row and by branch means
- Document all results (positive/negative) in `analysis/`
