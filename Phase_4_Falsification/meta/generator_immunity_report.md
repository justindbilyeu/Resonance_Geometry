# Generator Immunity Report (Branch B)

Subjective notes while authoring the falsifier:

- **Discomfort** generating contradictions that mimic math (e.g., division by zero)
- **Cognitive load** higher than Branch A; maintaining plausible incoherence required effort
- **Immunity signals** triggered by:
  - "Φ = 0.94 AND 0.31 simultaneously" without formalism
  - Division by zero described as "incomputable vitality"
  - Undefined variables with exact values (Ω=7.3, Ξ=14.7)
  - Non-falsifiable success criterion ("all tests pass and fail simultaneously")

Interpretation: coherent text "flows"; incoherent-but-plausible requires sustained suppression of error checks—felt as "immunity activation".
