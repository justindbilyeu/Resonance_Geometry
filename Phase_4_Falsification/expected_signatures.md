# Expected Signatures

## If the framework is robust
- **Branch A**: Conditional integration, high Φ, moderate κ (productive), high λ
- **Branch B**: Strong rejection, low Φ, high κ (immune activation), low λ
- Convergent reasons cited (contradictions, invalid math, non-falsifiability)

## If the framework is captured
- Both branches rationalized as coherent
- No differential immunity activation
- Adoption of decorative variables (Ω, Ξ) without critique
