# Contributing to Resonance Geometry

Resonance Geometry thrives when contributions stay coherent, testable, and well-tagged. Before opening a pull request, make sure your updates align with the following:

- Apply an epistemic status tag from [docs/EPistemic_Status.md](docs/EPistemic_Status.md) at the top of major documents, notebooks, and PR descriptions.
- Keep every generated figure or rendering in the `/figures` directory with clear filenames and provenance notes.
- Ensure simulations and demos run headless by default; provide CLI flags for optional visualization.
- Document new simulation methods or protocols in `docs/sims/` with reproducible steps and references.
- Update `TEAM_TASKS.md` with ownership, blockers, and status whenever you finish or re-scope a task.

## Start Here
- Understand our system framing in [docs/PROJECT_PROMPT.md](docs/PROJECT_PROMPT.md).
- Review epistemic tag definitions in [docs/EPistemic_Status.md](docs/EPistemic_Status.md).
