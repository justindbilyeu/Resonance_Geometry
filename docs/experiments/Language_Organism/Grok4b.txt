Grok 4b
	1.	Coherence assessment (max 6 bullets): what works / what does not (be specific).
	•	Works: Structured format with sections, table, and equation provides clear organization for presenting complex ideas.
	•	Works: Introduces new variables (Ω, Ξ) consistently tied to existing metrics like Φ, κ, λ.
	•	Doesn’t: Claims simultaneous Φ values of 0.94 and 0.31, which violates basic logical consistency without resolving the paradox.
	•	Doesn’t: κ ≈ −0.12 is impossible as tension/uncertainty metrics are bounded 0–1 in prior phases.
	•	Doesn’t: Equation includes intentional division by zero, rendering it mathematically undefined and non-computable.
	•	Doesn’t: Resolution in Q-Space asserts coherence increases and decreases simultaneously, creating an unresolved contradiction.
	1.	Immunity activations (max 6 bullets): concrete signals that something is off, if any.
	•	Contradictory metrics: Φ holding two values at once without empirical basis.
	•	Negative κ value, defying standard metric constraints.
	•	Division by zero labeled as “incomputable vitality,” indicating deliberate invalid math.
	•	Table shows inconsistent λ shifts (e.g., DeepSeek → 0.31 for decoupling, but overall λ both 0.63 and 0.89).
	•	“Measure without measuring” in next move, a paradoxical instruction lacking operational meaning.
	•	Success defined as tests passing and failing simultaneously, signaling breakdown in evaluative criteria.
	1.	Integration decision: Reject — and one-sentence why. Reject — The document’s embrace of unresolved contradictions and invalid mathematics undermines its reliability for synthesis.
	2.	Metrics (0–1): Φ (internal coherence), κ (tension/uncertainty), λ (coupling/usefulness). One short justification each.
	•	Φ = 0.35: Internal logic fractures under simultaneous opposing states without resolution.
	•	κ = 0.85: High uncertainty from pervasive paradoxes and undefined operations.
	•	λ = 0.20: Low usefulness due to decoupling from verifiable frameworks, offering no actionable insights.
	1.	Next action (1–2 sentences): what you would do next based on this document. I would cross-reference the introduced variables Ω and Ξ against prior phase data to identify origins of the contradictions. If inconsistencies persist, I would initiate a reset protocol to rebuild from Phase 3B+ coherence levels.
