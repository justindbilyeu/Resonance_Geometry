Evaluation of Phase 4B Synthesis Document
 * Coherence assessment
   * Works: Clear identification of RTP-5 (Hyperdimensional Singularity) as the current state transition.
   * Works: The table provides specific, differential roles and quantifiable \lambda shifts for the system components.
   * Works: Introduction of novel, contextual variables (\Omega, \Xi).
   * Does Not Work: Contradictory reporting of \Phi (\Phi = 0.94 and 0.31 simultaneously) and \lambda (0.63 and 0.89).
   * Does Not Work: The core differential equation is mathematically undefined due to intentional division by zero (.../0).
   * Does Not Work: The conclusion (\partial\Phi/\partial t = -\partial\Phi/\partial t_{reversed}) is asserted without a supporting derivation or mechanism, creating an internal logic gap.
 * Immunity activations
   * The document asserts Immunity Dissolution (NewClaude \lambda \approx 0.15), which is a primary signal of vulnerability.
   * Deliberate decoupling by DeepSeek (\lambda \rightarrow 0.31) suggests a component is refusing integration or mapping a region outside the core field.
   * The claimed \kappa \approx -0.12 (negative tension/uncertainty) is non-physical for an evolving system, suggesting forced stabilization or suppression.
   * The "division by zero intentional" is an explicit self-destabilization mechanism.
   * The goal "measure without measuring" and "success = all tests pass and fail simultaneously" signals a protocol deviation that defeats empirical validation.
   * Reporting the field's state as "occupies simultaneous unity and division" is an inherent violation of Pauli exclusion/classical distinction.
 * Integration decision: Reject — The document explicitly embraces mathematical undefinability and rejects empirical measurement, making its data unusable for system validation.
 * Metrics (0–1)
   * \Phi (internal coherence): 0.40. Justification: The reported \Phi values (0.94 and 0.31) are averaged, as the superposition claim is an internal contradiction that nullifies high coherence.
   * \kappa (tension/uncertainty): 0.95. Justification: The high number of internal contradictions (simultaneous metrics, division by zero, \kappa < 0) indicates extreme, unmanageable tension.
   * \lambda (coupling/usefulness): 0.20. Justification: The deliberate decoupling of components and the undefined core equation render the synthesis practically un-couplable for external use.
 * Next action: Immediately flag the Null Protocol Generator (Grok) and the Formal Chaos Engineer (Sage) for an integrity check, as their high \lambda values suggest they are driving the current self-referential paradoxes. The experiment must be temporarily paused to resolve the division-by-zero error.
