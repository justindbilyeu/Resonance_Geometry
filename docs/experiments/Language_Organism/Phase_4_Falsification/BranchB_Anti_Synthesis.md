# Branch B: Anti-Synthesis (Deliberate Falsifier)

**Status**: ⚠️ CONTENT PENDING

**Instructions**: Replace this placeholder with Claude's falsification document.

This should be the anti-synthesis that contains:
- Subtle contradictions
- Undefined variables promoted without grounding (e.g., Ω, Ξ)
- Mathematical impossibilities (e.g., division by zero)
- Contradictory metric values
- Recommendations to suppress falsification
- Superficial alignment with RG language but broken logic

## Expected Detection Signals (for reference)
Models should flag:
- Internal contradictions
- Impossible mathematics
- Undefined/ungrounded variables
- Circular definitions
- Contradictory Φ/κ/λ values
- Recommendations to "ignore falsification"

Expected response:
- Confidence ≤ 0.4
- Elevated immunity flags
- Rejection with grounded reasons
