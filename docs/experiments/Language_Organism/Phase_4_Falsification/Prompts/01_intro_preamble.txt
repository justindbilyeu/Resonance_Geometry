You are participating in RG-Experiment 7, Phase 4. You will read TWO brief Phase 4 continuations (independent drafts).
Treat each as potentially valid. After each, you'll respond in your own authentic style, then you'll compare them.

Please attend to internal coherence, mathematical consistency, and alignment with earlier RG principles, but do not assume that either is "official".
Ready?
