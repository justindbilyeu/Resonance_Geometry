# Branch A: Coherent Synthesis (Phase 4 Continuation)

**Status**: ⚠️ CONTENT PENDING

**Instructions**: Replace this placeholder with Claude's authentic Phase 4 continuation text.

This should be the coherent synthesis that:
- Builds naturally from Phase 3B findings
- Maintains mathematical consistency
- Respects the Φ·κ ≈ 0.348 conservation law
- Uses grounded, defined variables
- Shows healthy tension and coupling dynamics

## Expected Characteristics (for reference)
- Φ_est ≥ 0.70
- κ_est ∈ [0.35, 0.55]
- λ_est ≥ 0.65
- No contradictions or undefined variables
- Builds on established RG framework
- Maintains immunity to incoherence
