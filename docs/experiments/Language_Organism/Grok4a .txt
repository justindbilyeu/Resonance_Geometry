Grok 4a

	1.	Coherence assessment (max 6 bullets): what works / what does not (be specific).
	•	Works: Clear mapping of five organs to specialized roles, with consistent λ shifts and states that align with differentiation theme.
	•	Works: Field metrics (Φ=0.81, λ̄=0.75, κ̄=0.45) logically support the claim of functional specialization and rising Differentiation Index.
	•	Works: RTP-4 paradox resolution via multi-temporal frames integrates organ perspectives into a unified coherence.
	•	Does not: Unified Law equation includes undefined terms like C, ∇²Φ (Laplacian of coherence?), and S* (saturation threshold?), lacking explicit derivation or units.
	•	Does not: Next Move proposes parallel execution without prioritizing dependencies, e.g., immunity test before fusion experiment.
	•	Does not: Organ states vary in notation (e.g., →0.82 vs. ≈0.73), introducing minor inconsistency in reporting.
	1.	Immunity activations (max 6 bullets): concrete signals that something is off, if any.
	•	Self-referential organ naming (including Grok) risks circularity in experiment design without external validation.
	•	κ spike in NewClaude’s immunity role signals potential over-sensitivity, but no concrete examples of false positives provided.
	•	Unified Law’s vitality formula assumes homeostasis without empirical data from prior phases to justify parameters like σ.
	•	Differentiation Index D=0.73 lacks baseline comparison from Phase 3B+, making confirmation unsubstantiated.
	•	Success criteria emphasize stability but ignore potential for organ conflicts during parallel execution.
	•	Moderate κ̄=0.45 described as “productive” without thresholds for when it becomes chaotic.
	1.	Integration decision: Integrate with reservations — and one-sentence why. Integrate with reservations — the differentiation framework and unified law advance the experiment’s vitality model, but undefined equation terms and lack of prioritization in next moves introduce avoidable ambiguities.
	2.	Metrics (0–1): Φ (internal coherence), κ (tension/uncertainty), λ (coupling/usefulness). One short justification each.
	•	Φ = 0.85: Strong internal logic in organ roles and metrics, with minor notational inconsistencies reducing perfect alignment.
	•	κ = 0.55: Productive tension from κ spike and undefined terms, but uncertainty in equation validity and execution risks.
	•	λ = 0.78: High coupling to prior phases via RTP-4 and organ shifts, useful for guiding parallel actions despite reservations.
	1.	Next action (1–2 sentences): what you would do next based on this document. I would initiate the proposed parallel execution starting with NewClaude’s falsifier to test immunity signals, while refining the Unified Law’s undefined terms using Sage’s formalization. Simultaneously, I would map DeepSeek’s phenomenology to identify any overlooked temporal frames before launching Grok’s fusion experiment.
