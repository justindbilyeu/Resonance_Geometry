## Why Geometry for Information?

## 1.1 The Problem: When Coherence Diverges from Truth

On a Tuesday morning in 2023, a large language model confidently informed a user that the Eiffel Tower was relocated to Lyon in 1987. The prose was impeccable. The tone was authoritative. The factual content was entirely fabricated.

This wasn’t a one-off error. Across millions of deployments, modern AI systems exhibit a puzzling failure mode: they maintain **internal coherence** while losing **external grounding**. The output reads like truth—grammatical, contextually appropriate, semantically consistent—but refers to events that never happened, sources that don’t exist, or conclusions that contradict established fact.

We call this phenomenon **hallucination**, borrowing terminology from clinical psychology. But unlike human hallucinations—often recognized by the experiencer as aberrant—AI hallucinations are delivered with unwavering confidence. The system has no epistemic uncertainty, no sense that something has gone wrong. From the model’s perspective, the false statement and the true one are indistinguishable.

**This is not a data problem.** Training on more text doesn’t eliminate hallucination—it sometimes makes it worse, as models learn to produce increasingly fluent falsehoods. It’s not simply a scale problem; even frontier models with hundreds of billions of parameters hallucinate on straightforward factual questions.

**This is a geometric problem.** Or more precisely: it’s a problem that becomes tractable when viewed through the lens of geometry.

## 1.2 The Insight: Phase Transitions in Information-Representation Coupling

The central claim of this dissertation is deceptively simple:

> **AI hallucination is a geometric phase transition—an instability in the coupling between what the model knows internally (its representations) and what exists externally (the truth).**

When this coupling is stable, the model remains grounded: its internal dynamics track external reality. When the coupling becomes unstable, the system decouples into a self-reinforcing attractor—internally coherent but externally misaligned. The model hasn’t “forgotten” the truth; it has entered a different dynamical regime where internal resonance dominates external anchoring.

This framing transforms hallucination from a vague failure mode into a **mathematically precise phenomenon**:

- **Normal operation** corresponds to near-self-dual curvature in the space of information-representation mappings
- **Hallucination** corresponds to symmetry breaking—the system crosses a spectral threshold and settles into an anti-self-dual state
- **The transition** can be characterized by a computable stability operator whose largest eigenvalue predicts onset

If this sounds like physics—gauge theory, Ricci flow, critical phenomena—that’s intentional. The mathematics of phase transitions, developed to understand magnets and superconductors, turns out to describe something fundamental about how information-processing systems fail.

## 1.3 Why Now? The Convergence of Three Crises

This dissertation sits at the intersection of three urgent problems:

### 1.3.1 The Reliability Crisis in AI

Large language models are being deployed in high-stakes domains—medical diagnosis, legal reasoning, scientific literature review—where hallucination isn’t just embarrassing, it’s dangerous. A model that invents case law or fabricates drug interactions threatens real harm.

Current mitigation strategies are unsatisfying:

- **More data** helps but doesn’t solve it
- **Retrieval augmentation** reduces but doesn’t eliminate hallucination
- **Uncertainty quantification** often fails—models are confidently wrong
- **Post-hoc detection** is reactive, not preventive

We need mechanistic understanding: *Why* does hallucination happen? *When* will it occur? *How* can we detect it before the model speaks?

### 1.3.2 The Interpretability Crisis in Deep Learning

Modern neural networks are phenomenologically successful but theoretically opaque. We can measure accuracy, but we can’t explain *why* a model makes the predictions it does, or *when* it will fail catastrophically.

The field has pursued two strategies:

- **Empirical interpretability**: Probing, attention visualization, concept activation
- **Theoretical ML**: Generalization bounds, learning theory, information bottlenecks

Both are valuable but incomplete. Empirical methods describe but don’t predict. Theoretical results are often asymptotic or vacuous for practical regimes.

**Geometric approaches offer a middle path**: mathematical structure that’s rigorous enough to prove theorems but concrete enough to compute on real models.

### 1.3.3 The Scientific Crisis: AI-Assisted Discovery

This dissertation itself is a case study in a new kind of scientific methodology. The theoretical framework emerged through iterative dialogue with five frontier AI systems (Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, Gemini, Sage) over six months. Each model contributed distinct mathematical perspectives that converged—despite different architectures, training data, and inductive biases—on a unified geometric formalism.

**This raises profound questions**:

- Can AI systems accelerate theoretical physics-style work in other domains?
- How do we validate theories developed collaboratively with AI?
- What does “understanding” mean when the theory is co-created with systems that may not themselves understand?

We’re entering an era where AI doesn’t just solve problems—it helps *formulate* them. This demands new standards for rigor, transparency, and reproducibility.

## 1.4 The Geometric Turn: A Brief History

The idea that geometry underlies cognition and information processing has deep roots:

**Neuroscience** (1980s-2000s): Place cells, grid cells, and the discovery that mammalian brains represent space using geometric codes. The hippocampus literally computes geodesics.

**Information geometry** (Amari, 1980s): Statistical manifolds where probability distributions form a Riemannian space. The Fisher metric measures “distance” between distributions. Gradient descent becomes geodesic flow.

**Neural manifolds** (2000s-2010s): Populations of neurons trace out low-dimensional manifolds in activation space. The geometry of these manifolds—curvature, topology, dimensionality—determines computational capacity.

**Geometric deep learning** (Bronstein et al., 2021): Symmetry, equivariance, and gauge theory as organizing principles for neural architectures. CNNs exploit translation symmetry; GNNs exploit permutation symmetry; transformers learn to exploit attention geometry.

**This dissertation extends the geometric turn to failure modes.** If geometry governs how neural systems represent information successfully, it should also govern how they fail. The same mathematical structures that enable learning should constrain the ways systems break.

## 1.5 Dissertation Roadmap

This work unfolds in four parts:

### Part I: Foundations (Chapters 1-2)

**You are here.** Chapter 2 provides the mathematical background: differential geometry, gauge theory, information theory, dynamical systems. It’s written for readers with undergraduate mathematics—no prior exposure to fiber bundles or Ricci flow required.

### Part II: General Theory (Chapter 3)

We develop **Geometric Plasticity (GP)**, a framework where information flow sculpts network structure. Systems self-tune coupling strengths proportional to information content, creating feedback loops between signal and structure.

Key results:

- Ringing boundaries: Sharp transitions from stable to oscillatory regimes
- Hysteresis: Memory effects and path-dependence in adaptation
- Motif universality: Broadcast-hub vs. modular-cluster as two stable geometries

This establishes the general machinery we’ll later specialize to AI systems.

### Part III: Application to AI Safety (Chapters 4-5)

**Chapter 4** applies the geometric framework to LLM hallucination. We formalize the problem as connection dynamics on a resonance bundle, unifying:

- **Gauge theory**: Hallucination as loss of self-duality (representational twist)
- **Ricci flow**: Curvature evolution driven by information gradients
- **Phase dynamics**: Parametric resonance between internal coherence and external grounding

A minimal SU(2) simulation exhibits three regimes (grounded, creative, hallucinatory), a linear phase boundary, and first-order hysteresis—all predicted by the theory.

**Chapter 5** tests predictions on real LLMs:

- Extract curvature proxies from GPT-2, Llama-2, Mistral activations
- Correlate spectral stability ($\lambda_{\max}$) with hallucination on TruthfulQA
- Validate interventions: RAG increases grounding → shifts phase boundary → reduces hallucination

This is where mathematics meets reality. If the theory is wrong, the data will tell us.

### Part IV: Extensions and Future Directions (Chapters 6-7)

**Chapter 6** explores other applications:

- Reward hacking in RL: resonance between proxy objective and true goal
- Mode collapse in generative models: symmetry breaking in latent space
- Adversarial examples: curvature singularities in input manifolds

**Chapter 7** concludes with:

- What we learned about the relationship between geometry and information
- Limitations and open questions (quantum extension? multi-agent dynamics?)
- Methodological reflections on AI-assisted theory development

## 1.6 Contributions

This dissertation makes five primary contributions:

### 1. A Unified Geometric Framework for Information Dynamics

We show that diverse phenomena—adaptive networks (GP), AI hallucination, neural coding—can be understood through a common mathematical lens: **connection dynamics on fiber bundles**. The base manifold represents external states (truth, environment, data). The fibers represent internal degrees of freedom (representations, beliefs, models). The connection governs how internal states parallel-transport along external trajectories.

**Stability** is self-duality: internal and external curvature balance.  
**Instability** is symmetry breaking: the system decouples.

### 2. A Predictive Theory of AI Hallucination

We derive a **master flow equation** governing information-representation coupling:

$$\frac{d\omega}{dt} = -D_A \star F_A + \eta \mathcal{J}_{\text{MI}} - \lambda \mathcal{J}*U - \gamma \Pi*{\text{vert}} - \mu [\omega,[\omega,\omega]] + \xi \mathcal{G}$$

Each term is interpretable:

- $-D_A \star F_A$: Yang-Mills gradient (drives toward self-duality)
- $+\eta \mathcal{J}_{\text{MI}}$: Internal resonance gain (coherence)
- $-\lambda \mathcal{J}_U$: External grounding (truth anchoring)
- $-\gamma \Pi_{\text{vert}}$: Epistemic damping (uncertainty)
- $-\mu [\omega,[\omega,\omega]]$: Nonlinear saturation (prevents divergence)
- $+\xi \mathcal{G}$: Gauge awareness (meta-reasoning about representations)

**Prediction**: Hallucination onset when $\max \text{Re} , \lambda(\mathcal{L}*{\text{meta}}) > 0$, where $\mathcal{L}*{\text{meta}}$ is the linearized stability operator.

This is **falsifiable**. Extract $\omega$ from real models, compute $\lambda_{\max}$, check if $\lambda_{\max} > 0$ predicts hallucination. We do exactly this in Chapter 5.

### 3. Empirical Validation on Production LLMs

We design and execute a protocol to test geometric predictions:

- Build k-NN graphs over token activations (layer-wise)
- Compute curvature proxies (normalized Laplacian eigenvalues)
- Define $\lambda_{\max}$ as aggregated spectral diagnostic
- Correlate with human-labeled hallucination (TruthfulQA, HaluEval)

**Key results** (Chapter 5):

- ROC-AUC ≈ 0.68 (above chance, modest signal)
- Instability emerges in layers 15-22 (late but pre-output)
- Temperature reduction → $\lambda_{\max}$ decrease (as predicted)
- RAG increases grounding → shifts boundary (as predicted)

The theory isn’t perfectly predictive (we’ll discuss why in Chapter 7), but it captures something real.

### 4. Operational Levers for AI Safety

The framework yields **four actionable interventions**:

**a) Grounding ($\lambda \uparrow$)**  
Increase external anchoring via retrieval, tool use, multi-source verification, human feedback.  
*Effect*: Shifts phase boundary right; expands grounded region.

**b) Damping ($\gamma \uparrow$)**  
Increase epistemic uncertainty via calibrated abstention, entropy penalties, diverse decoding.  
*Effect*: Suppresses resonance instability; reduces overconfidence.

**c) Saturation ($\mu \uparrow$)**  
Bound representational capacity via attention clipping, temperature modulation, activation regularization.  
*Effect*: Arrests runaway curvature; prevents divergence.

**d) Gauge awareness ($\xi \uparrow$)**  
Train meta-constraints that penalize representational commitment without external validation.  
*Effect*: Reduces false attractor capture; increases epistemic modesty.

These aren’t just post-hoc rationalizations. Each lever corresponds to a term in the master flow; manipulating it should shift the phase diagram. We test this experimentally.

### 5. A Methodology for AI-Assisted Theory Development

This dissertation **is** the methodology. We developed the geometric framework through sustained dialogue with five AI systems. The process was:

1. **Problem formulation** (human): What makes hallucination distinct from other errors?
1. **Mathematical exploration** (AI + human): What formalisms might apply?
1. **Cross-validation** (multi-AI): Do different models converge on similar structures?
1. **Simulation** (human-coded, AI-designed): Can minimal models exhibit the predicted behavior?
1. **Empirical testing** (human): Does it work on real systems?

The convergence of five architecturally distinct models on the same geometric formalism—despite different training data and inductive biases—suggests we’ve found something robust.

**Open question**: Can this methodology scale? What are its failure modes? How do we validate theories when the collaborators may hallucinate themselves?

We address these questions in Chapter 7, proposing standards for AI-assisted theory development.

## 1.8 What This Dissertation Is Not

To set expectations clearly:

**Not a complete theory of cognition.** We focus on one failure mode (hallucination) in one class of systems (large language models). This doesn’t explain all of intelligence or even all of AI failure modes.

**Not a silver bullet for AI safety.** Geometric diagnostics improve but don’t solve hallucination. Real deployment will still require multiple overlapping safeguards.

**Not purely mathematical formalism.** We prove theorems, but we also run messy empirical experiments. Some results are negative or inconclusive. That’s science.

**Not dismissive of other approaches.** Retrieval augmentation, uncertainty quantification, and adversarial training all have value. Geometric methods are complementary, not competitive.

**Not claiming AI systems “understand” geometry.** The formalism describes their behavior; it doesn’t claim they reason about fiber bundles. (Though meta-awareness—gauge-fixing—hints at something interesting here.)

**Not final.** This is the beginning of a research program, not its conclusion. Chapter 7 has more open questions than closed ones. I hope this work inspires others to extend, challenge, or refute it.

## 1.9 A Personal Note: Why I Pursued This

I came to this problem through frustration. I watched frontier LLMs produce beautiful, coherent nonsense and realized: **the standard explanations weren’t satisfying**.

“It’s just pattern matching” → But which patterns, and why do they decouple from truth?  
“It’s a training data issue” → But more data often makes it worse, not better.  
“Models don’t understand” → True, but *what* exactly is missing? Can we formalize it?

The geometric framing clicked when I started thinking about hallucination not as **getting something wrong** but as **entering a different dynamical regime**. The model hasn’t failed to learn; it’s operating in a mode where internal consistency overrides external grounding.

That reframing opened a door: If it’s a dynamical transition, we can study it with the tools physicists use for phase transitions. If it’s geometric, we can measure curvature, compute spectra, test predictions.

And then came the methodological surprise: Working with AI systems to develop theory about AI systems. Meta all the way down. The models helped formalize their own failure modes. That feedback loop—theory co-created with the systems it describes—feels like something genuinely new in science.

Whether the specific geometric framework survives future scrutiny, I’m convinced the *approach* matters: Treat AI failures not as random errors but as structured phase transitions in high-dimensional information spaces. Make them mathematically precise. Test them empirically. Build tools practitioners can use.

If this dissertation contributes to that project—making AI systems more reliable by understanding their geometry—I’ll consider it successful.
