## Open Questions & Research Directions

### Theoretical
1. Can we rigorously derive the master flow from first principles?
2. What determines the structure group G in real neural networks?
3. How does the framework extend to discrete token spaces?
4. Is there a quantum extension of the RG formalism?

### Empirical
1. Which curvature proxy best predicts hallucination?
2. Do the three regimes exist in real LLMs?
3. Can we extract Œª_max efficiently during inference?
4. Does meta-resonance training reduce hallucination without harming creativity?

### Methodological
1. How do we validate AI-assisted theoretical development?
2. What are best practices for multi-model collaboration?
3. Can this methodology extend to other scientific domains?
