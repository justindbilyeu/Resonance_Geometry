## Dissertation Overview

This dissertation develops a geometric framework for understanding phase transitions in information-processing systems, with applications to AI safety and reliability.

**Central Thesis**: Complex information dynamics—from biological networks to artificial intelligence—exhibit geometric phase transitions that can be formalized using differential geometry, gauge theory, and dynamical systems theory.

## How to Read This Dissertation (by audience)

- **ML / AI safety practitioners**: Read Chapter 1 for the roadmap, then the executive summary portions of Chapter 3, followed by Chapter 4’s hallucination scaffold. Circle back to Chapter 2 only as needed for notation.
- **Mathematics / theory readers**: Begin with Chapter 2 for background, then read Chapter 3 in full for the axioms and stability analysis. Chapter 4 highlights how the master flow and λ_max diagnostics port into LLMs.
- **Phenomenology / philosophy readers**: Pair Chapter 1 with Chapter 4’s reflective framing and conclude with Chapter 4’s retrospective elements for method and meaning.

## Build Instructions

Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a LaTeX engine (XeLaTeX recommended), then run:

```
./scripts/build_dissertation.sh
```

The script uses `docs/dissertation/pandoc_defaults_dissertation.yaml` to stitch the chapter files listed in `Dissertation.md` and writes the PDF to `docs/dissertation/build/resonance_geometry_dissertation.pdf`.

```bash
make dissertation
# or
./build.sh dissertation
```

Output: `docs/dissertation/build/resonance_geometry_dissertation.pdf`.

Pandoc with a LaTeX engine (e.g., `xelatex`) is required. Figures resolve via `docs/assets/` and `docs/data/`.
