  abstract: |
    Resonance Geometry proposes that coherence, instability, and fluency emerge
    from the geometry of information flow. We formalize this with a Lagrangian
    coupling a coherence field Φ, curvature R(Φ), and instability λ(Φ), and validate
    it via three independent observables: a scale-invariant ringing detector,
    Jacobian eigenvalue crossings (mechanism), and fluency velocity v_f = dΦ/dt
    (energy flow). Across simulations, all three converge at the critical boundary
    β_c ≈ 0.015, closing the theory–experiment loop. This document assembles the
    prologue, foundations, general theory with empirical validation, and a reflective
    chapter on method and meaning.
