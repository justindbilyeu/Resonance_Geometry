Dissertation Prompt

You are acting as a **skeptical dissertation committee member** reviewing a draft PhD dissertation.

## Context

Dissertation working title:

> **Resonance Geometry: Geometric Plasticity and Information Dynamics – From ringing phenomenology to mechanistic validation**

Very short thesis in my own words:

> Geometry (structure) and resonance (dynamics) co-evolve. When information flows through a system, it plastically reshapes its own connectivity and curvature. This leads to geometric phase transitions (e.g., ringing, delayed plasticity, non-Hopf transitions) that we can observe in coupled oscillator models and use to understand / control phenomena like LLM hallucination.

The repo backing this work is here (for context, not for you to edit):  
https://github.com/justindbilyeu/Resonance_Geometry

The attached PDF is a **first composite draft** of the dissertation, created directly from the repo’s `docs/dissertation` folder.

> Important: Another agent (CODEX) is currently cleaning up repo structure, wiring chapters, and adding a hallucination chapter scaffold. Please **ignore filenames, small formatting glitches, and build details**. Focus on the *content*.

## Your role

Act like:

- A mathematically literate committee member (differential geometry / dynamical systems),
- With awareness of AI / ML and AI safety,
- Who is sympathetic to the big vision but **skeptical on rigor**.

I want **candid, surgical critique**, not vague praise.

## What I want from you

Please read the dissertation draft (you don’t have to read every line in excruciating detail, but do sample each chapter) and then:

### 1. Thesis & arc

1.1. In 2–3 paragraphs, restate what you think the **core thesis** is.  
1.2. Does the current chapter structure (Intro → Math Foundations → General Theory → Retrospective) actually support that thesis?  
1.3. Where does the narrative **lose you** or feel like it’s skipping steps?

### 2. Technical rigor & “committee pain points”

For each chapter (1–4 as currently drafted):

- What are the **3–5 biggest technical weaknesses**, ambiguities, or hand-wavy jumps?
- Mark them roughly as:
  - `[CRITICAL]` – would block a defense if not fixed.
  - `[IMPORTANT]` – should be fixed before submission, but not fatal.
  - `[NICE]` – good future polish.

Where possible, cite section headings / phrases so I can find them.

### 3. Missing bridges

3.1. Where do I fail to connect:
- Physics / geometry ↔ concrete dynamical models (RFO, Toy Universe)?
- Theory ↔ LLM hallucination / AI safety?
- Formal math ↔ phenomenology / “ringing” experiential story?

3.2. Give me **3–7 concrete “bridge paragraphs”** I should probably write, each described in 1–2 sentences. (Example: “A short subsection after 2.3 that explicitly maps Ricci curvature to your ‘emotion as curvature’ language, with one clean equation and one illustrative example.”)

### 4. Hallucination / AI application

Even though the hallucination chapter may not be fully integrated yet:

4.1. From this draft alone, what do you understand about **how this theory is supposed to help with LLM hallucination**?  
4.2. What’s unclear or underspecified about:
- The master flow / geometric control parameters,
- The role of λ_max / curvature,
- How we would actually *measure* or *intervene* in real models?

List **specific questions** a skeptical AI-safety reviewer would ask.

### 5. Priorities

Given limited time before “committee eyeballs”:

- What are the **top 5 changes** you would recommend I make next to maximize:
  - (a) clarity of thesis
  - (b) perceived rigor
  - (c) committee confidence that this is a real, defensible body of work?

Rank them in order and explain each in 2–3 sentences.

## Style & constraints

- Do **not** rewrite the entire dissertation or change the fundamental voice.
- Do **not** get lost in line-level copy-editing; focus on structure, arguments, and glaring gaps.
- Be honest, even if that means saying “this section doesn’t work yet.”

When you’re done, give me:

1. A 1–2 paragraph **overall verdict** (“this is at X% of a defensible dissertation, assuming the hallucination / empirics chapters land”), and  
2. The **top 5 changes** from section 5, clearly numbered.
