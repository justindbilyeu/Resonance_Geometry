# Epistemic Status Tags

Use these tags to communicate how confident we are in a claim or artifact. They should appear at the top of documents, pull requests, and major updates.

## [Epistemic Status: MATHEMATICAL-METAPHOR]
Translates rigorous math into narrative or visual language while staying anchored to derivations.
Highlights intuitive bridges that guide collaborators toward formal models without claiming proof.
Example: a diagram in `docs/philosophy/` explaining tensor harmonics via dance metaphors.

## [Epistemic Status: TESTABLE-HYPOTHESIS]
Specifies a measurable prediction that could be falsified with current or near-future experiments.
Outlines required instruments, datasets, or simulations and the success criteria.
Example: a protocol in `docs/sims/` for validating resonance phase-locking with recorded biosignals.

## [Epistemic Status: SPECULATIVE-THEORY]
Explores frontier ideas that stretch beyond present evidence but fit our conceptual scaffold.
Marks invitations for critique, extension, or reframing before implementation efforts begin.
Example: a roadmap in `docs/philosophy/` mapping consciousness states to novel resonance manifolds.
