\textbf{Figure 1. Eigenvalue trajectories across coupling $\alpha$.}
(\textbf{Left}) Narrow sweep ($\alpha\in[0.25,0.55]$) shows the maximum real part of the Jacobian eigenvalues remains strictly negative; the observed resonant transition point (vertical line at $\alpha=0.35$) thus does not coincide with a Hopf bifurcation.
(\textbf{Right}) A wide sweep ($\alpha\in[0.10,1.00]$) reveals a conventional stability loss with $\mathrm{Re}\,\lambda_{\max}$ crossing zero near $\alpha^\star\approx0.832$. These results indicate two distinct phenomena: an early global geometric reorganization (non-Hopf RTP) and a later local instability (Hopf-like crossing).
