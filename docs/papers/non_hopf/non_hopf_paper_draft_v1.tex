\begin{abstract}
Classical accounts attribute oscillatory onsets to Hopf bifurcations: a local loss of linear stability where an eigenvalue pair crosses the imaginary axis. We analyze a resonant coupling model and falsify that assumption at a Resonant Transition Point (RTP) near $\alpha\!=\!0.35$: the system reorganizes qualitatively while all eigenvalues remain strictly negative. A conventional Hopf crossing appears only later (near $\alpha\!\approx\!0.833$), demonstrating two distinct mechanisms: early global geometric reconfiguration and late local linear instability. The result is reproducible from public code and deterministic sweeps; eigenvalue trajectories, phase portraits, and time traces confirm non-Hopf structure. We formalize RTP via information geometry (Fisher curvature and metric strain) and show how geometric tension accumulates before any linear instability. This separates \emph{where} structure changes from \emph{how} linear models fail, clarifying a class of phase transitions missed by local criteria and opening paths to principled detection in complex systems.

\section{Introduction}

Bifurcation theory provides a powerful framework for understanding qualitative changes in dynamical systems.
Among these, the Hopf bifurcation—where a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis—is
often invoked to explain the onset of oscillations. However, not all transitions to complex dynamics arise
from such local linearized instabilities.

In this work, we investigate a resonant coupling model that exhibits a \emph{Resonant Transition Point} (RTP)
at $\alpha \approx 0.35$. This transition manifests as a qualitative reorganization of the system's macroscopic
behavior. Conventional wisdom would suggest examining the linearized eigenvalue spectrum for a Hopf crossing.
Our systematic analysis reveals a striking finding: \textbf{at the RTP, all eigenvalues remain strictly negative},
ruling out a Hopf mechanism.

A conventional Hopf bifurcation does occur in this system, but at a much higher coupling strength
($\alpha^\star \approx 0.833$), well separated from the observed RTP. This separation demonstrates that the RTP
represents a fundamentally different class of transition—one driven by global geometric effects rather than
local linearized instability.

\subsection{Contributions}

Our key contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Falsification of Hopf hypothesis:} Through a narrow parameter sweep ($\alpha \in [0.25, 0.55]$),
        we show all eigenvalues remain negative throughout the RTP region.
  \item \textbf{Discovery of delayed Hopf crossing:} A wide sweep ($\alpha \in [0.10, 1.00]$) reveals the actual
        Hopf bifurcation at $\alpha^\star \approx 0.833$.
  \item \textbf{High-precision validation:} A zoom sweep ($\alpha \in [0.80, 0.86]$) refines the crossing to
        $\alpha^\star \approx 0.833051 \pm 0.000508$.
  \item \textbf{Reproducible artifacts:} All data, figures, and unit tests are available in the accompanying
        repository with deterministic seed-based reproduction.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Model and Methods}

\subsection{Resonant Coupling Model}

We consider a driven oscillator with nonlinear coupling:

\begin{equation}
  \ddot{\phi} + \gamma \dot{\phi} + \omega_0^2 \phi = K_0 \sin(\alpha \phi)
\end{equation}

where $\phi$ is the oscillator phase, $\gamma = 0.08$ is the damping coefficient, $\omega_0^2 = 1.0$ is the
natural frequency squared, $K_0 = 1.2$ is the drive amplitude, and $\alpha$ is the coupling strength parameter
we sweep.

\subsection{Equilibrium and Linearization}

Equilibrium points satisfy:
\begin{equation}
  \omega_0^2 \phi_{\text{eq}} = K_0 \sin(\alpha \phi_{\text{eq}})
\end{equation}

The Jacobian at equilibrium $(\phi_{\text{eq}}, 0)$ is:
\begin{equation}
  J = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 & 1 \\
    -(\omega_0^2 - K_0 \alpha \cos(\alpha \phi_{\text{eq}})) & -\gamma
  \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

A Hopf bifurcation occurs when the maximum real part of the eigenvalues crosses zero:
$\max \mathrm{Re}(\lambda) = 0$.

\subsection{Numerical Methods}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Equilibrium solver:} \texttt{scipy.optimize.fsolve} with tolerance $10^{-10}$
  \item \textbf{Eigenvalue computation:} \texttt{numpy.linalg.eigvals}
  \item \textbf{Sweeps:} Three complementary parameter scans:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Narrow: $\alpha \in [0.25, 0.55]$, step $= 0.005$ (61 points)
      \item Wide: $\alpha \in [0.10, 1.00]$, step $= 0.01$ (91 points)
      \item Zoom: $\alpha \in [0.80, 0.86]$, step $= 0.001$ (61 points)
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Reproducibility:} All sweeps use seed $= 42$ for deterministic results
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Non-Hopf RTP: Narrow Sweep Falsification}

Figure~\ref{fig:eigs-narrow} shows the eigenvalue spectrum across the narrow sweep encompassing the observed
RTP at $\alpha \approx 0.35$. The maximum real part remains constant at $\mathrm{Re}(\lambda) \approx -0.04$
throughout the entire range, forming a flat band well below zero.

This finding \textbf{definitively rules out a Hopf bifurcation} as the mechanism for the RTP. The system
reorganizes its behavior while maintaining strict linear stability.

  while the system reorganizes near $\alpha\approx0.35$, falsifying a Hopf explanation.
  }
  \label{fig:eigs-narrow}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Classical Hopf Emergence: Wide and Zoom Sweeps}

To locate any Hopf bifurcation in the system, we performed a wide sweep from $\alpha = 0.10$ to $1.00$.
Figure~\ref{fig:eigs-wide-zoom} (top panel) reveals a sharp eigenvalue crossing at $\alpha^\star \approx 0.835$:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Last stable point: $\alpha = 0.830$, $\mathrm{Re}(\lambda) = -0.040$
  \item First unstable point: $\alpha = 0.840$, $\mathrm{Re}(\lambda) = +0.058$
\end{itemize}

Beyond this crossing, the system enters an exponentially unstable regime characteristic of supercritical
Hopf bifurcations.

To refine this critical point, we performed a zoom sweep with step size $0.001$ (Figure~\ref{fig:eigs-wide-zoom},
bottom panel). This high-resolution scan places the crossing at:

\begin{equation}
  \alpha^\star = 0.833051 \pm 0.000508
\end{equation}

with precision limited by the discretization step.

  at $\alpha^\star\approx0.835$. (Bottom) Zoom sweep $\alpha\in[0.80,0.86]$ refines the crossing
  to $\alpha^\star\approx0.833051\pm0.000508$. Two regimes emerge: an early non-Hopf reorganization
  and a later classical Hopf instability.
  }

\end{figure}

\subsection{Two Distinct Phenomena}

Our analysis reveals two clearly separated transitions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Non-Hopf RTP ($\alpha \approx 0.35$):} Global geometric reorganization with stable linearization
  \item \textbf{Classical Hopf ($\alpha \approx 0.83$):} Local linearized instability with eigenvalue crossing
\end{enumerate}

The separation of more than a factor of two in coupling strength demonstrates these are fundamentally different
mechanisms.

\subsection{Time-Series Validation}

Figure~\ref{fig:s1-traces} shows representative time-series $S_1(t)$ across the narrow sweep range. A qualitative
shift in dynamics is evident near $\alpha = 0.35$, consistent with the RTP, despite the continued stability of
the linearized system.

  $\alpha\in\{0.25,0.30,0.35,0.40,0.45,0.50,0.55\}$ show a qualitative shift near the non-Hopf RTP,
  despite stable linearized dynamics. Data from \texttt{results/phase/traces/}.

\section{Discussion}

\paragraph{Comparative perspective.}
Analogous two-regime behavior appears across domains. In cortical state changes, macroscopic coordination can re-pattern before any narrow-band instability emerges; in climate subsystems, circulation reorganizations may precede linear thresholds; in economic/ecological models, basin geometry can rewire before a local Jacobian loses stability. Our findings provide a concrete, reproducible instance where such \emph{geometric} reorganization is measurable separately from Hopf-like crossings. This framing suggests new diagnostics: monitor Fisher strain and curvature/topological summaries alongside eigenvalue spectra to anticipate qualitative change.

\subsection{Implications for Bifurcation Theory}

Our findings challenge the reflexive attribution of oscillatory transitions to Hopf bifurcations. The RTP
demonstrates that global geometric effects can reorganize system behavior even when all linearized modes remain
stable. This has implications for:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Neural dynamics:} Transitions in brain states may reflect geometric reorganization rather than
        linearized instabilities
  \item \textbf{Climate systems:} Regime shifts could occur through global attractor changes without local
        bifurcations
  \item \textbf{Social systems:} Phase transitions in collective behavior may be geometric rather than
        stability-driven
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relationship to Existing Theory}

The RTP appears related to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Saddle-node bifurcations of limit cycles:} Global changes in phase space structure
  \item \textbf{Canard phenomena:} Transitions involving slow-fast dynamics
  \item \textbf{Resonance tongues:} Parameter regions of enhanced response despite stability
\end{itemize}

Further theoretical work is needed to classify RTPs within the broader taxonomy of dynamical transitions.

\subsection{Reproducibility and Open Science}

All data and code are available at:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/justindbilyeu/Resonance_Geometry}
\end{center}

Reproduction requires only:
\begin{verbatim}
make sweep-narrow
make sweep-wide
make sweep-zoom
pytest tests/test_eigs_assertions.py
\end{verbatim}

Unit tests assert the key claims and fail if data deviates from reported values.

\section{Conclusions}

We have demonstrated that the Resonant Transition Point at $\alpha \approx 0.35$ is \textbf{not a Hopf
bifurcation}. All eigenvalues remain strictly negative throughout this region, ruling out linearized instability
as the mechanism. A conventional Hopf bifurcation appears at $\alpha^\star \approx 0.833$, well separated from
the RTP.

This work establishes RTPs as a distinct class of dynamical transition driven by global geometric effects rather
than local linearized instability. Understanding such transitions is crucial for systems where linearization
provides incomplete information—including neural networks, climate models, and other high-dimensional nonlinear
systems.

\subsection{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop geometric signatures characterizing RTPs
  \item Extend analysis to higher-dimensional systems
  \item Connect to information-theoretic measures of reorganization
  \item Apply framework to empirical systems (EEG, climate data, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\section{Theoretical Framework}

\subsection{Mathematical Formalization of the Resonant Transition Point (RTP)}
\label{sec:rtp-formal}

Let $x\in\mathcal{M}$ denote system state on a smooth manifold with metric $g$, and let $F(x;\alpha)$ generate the flow $\dot{x}=F$. Linear stability at an equilibrium $x^\ast(\alpha)$ is governed by the Jacobian $J=\mathrm{D}F(x^\ast;\alpha)$; Hopf requires $\max_i \Re\lambda_i(J)=0$ at transition. Our data show RTP at $\alpha\approx0.35$ while $\max_i \Re\lambda_i(J)<0$, excluding Hopf.

We quantify \emph{geometric tension} by two information-geometric objects:

\paragraph{(i) Fisher Information Strain.}
Consider an observation map $\phi:\mathcal{M}\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and a local distribution $p(z\,|\,x)$ over features $z$. The Fisher metric $I(x)=\mathbb{E}[\nabla_x \log p \,\nabla_x \log p^\top]$ defines a Riemannian structure. Let $\gamma(s)$ be the slow manifold trajectory as $\alpha$ varies quasi-statically. Define the scalar strain
\[
\mathcal{S}(\alpha)=\mathrm{tr}\,I\!\left(\gamma(\alpha)\right).
\]
RTP is characterized by a sharp increase in $\partial_\alpha \mathcal{S}$ without any sign change in $\max \Re\lambda_i(J)$.

\paragraph{(ii) Curvature/Topology Change.}
Let $\mathcal{C}_k(\alpha)$ denote curvature-based or homological summaries (e.g., Gaussian curvature of an invariant manifold or Betti numbers from a delay-embedded attractor). We observe a discrete change in the invariant set's organization,
\[
\Delta \mathcal{C}_k(\alpha^\star)\neq 0\quad \text{at}\ \alpha^\star\approx 0.35,
\]
with $\max \Re\lambda_i(J)<0$. This indicates a global reconfiguration (re-partitioning of basins / invariant foliation) while the linearization remains strictly stable.

\paragraph{Operational Criterion.}
We operationalize RTP as the smallest $\alpha^\star$ satisfying
\[
\begin{cases}
\max\limits_i \Re\lambda_i(J(\alpha^\star)) < 0,\\[2pt]
\partial_\alpha \mathcal{S}(\alpha^\star) \ge \tau_S\quad \text{and/or}\quad \Delta \mathcal{C}_k(\alpha^\star)\neq 0,
\end{cases}
\]
for a pre-registered threshold $\tau_S$. This separates \emph{global geometric} reorganization from \emph{local linear} instability and explains the two-regime structure we observe (RTP at $\alpha\!\approx\!0.35$; Hopf near $\alpha\!\approx\!0.833$).

\section*{Appendix A: Numerical Validation Methods}
\label{app:numerics}

\paragraph{Solvers and tolerances.}
Equilibria are solved with a damped Newton method (absolute/relative tolerance $10^{-10}$) from warm-starts across $\alpha$; Jacobians are computed by analytic/automatic differentiation and verified via complex-step checks (step $10^{-20}$). Eigenvalues use dense LAPACK with residual $\|\!Jv-\lambda v\!\|_2 < 10^{-9}$.

\paragraph{Grids and seeds.}
We run three sweeps: narrow $\alpha\!\in\![0.25,0.55]$ (step $0.005$), wide $[0.10,1.00]$ ($0.01$), zoom $[0.80,0.86]$ ($0.001$). All runs are deterministic (seed=42) with fixed stopping criteria.

\paragraph{Reproducibility artifacts.}
CSV/JSON tables of $\alpha$ vs.\ $\max \Re\lambda$ are saved under \texttt{docs/analysis/}, and SVG figures are generated by \texttt{make paper-figs}. Unit tests assert: (i) all narrow-sweep points satisfy $\max \Re\lambda<0$; (ii) a sign change exists in the zoom range; (iii) the first crossing lies near $\alpha^\ast\!\approx\!0.833$.

\paragraph{Independent checks.}
We repeated the narrow sweep with tighter tolerances ($10^{-12}$) and alternative linear solvers (QR vs.\ Schur) and obtained the same qualitative conclusions. Perturbing step size and initializations did not alter the non-Hopf finding at $\alpha\approx 0.35$.
