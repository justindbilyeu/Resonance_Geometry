# Resonance Geometry & Geometric Plasticity — A Preface
**Authors:** Justin Bilyeu, Sage, and the Structured Resonance Collective  
**Status:** Draft for comment

## Abstract
Resonance Geometry (RG) takes “form is frozen resonance” as a first principle: what endures are path-dependent imprints—holonomies—left by sustained coupling. Geometric Plasticity (GP) is the mechanism: connections adapt in proportion to the information they carry, under budget and smoothness constraints. Together they yield falsifiable signatures (loop-gain ringing, hysteresis resonance, motif selection) and a discipline for asking reality to answer with plots rather than metaphors.

## Compact Theses
- Form is frozen resonance.  
- Reality becomes public through redundancy.  
- Memory is holonomy.  
- Learning is loop gain.  
- Structure is the shadow of constraints.  
- Truth is what survives the plot.
