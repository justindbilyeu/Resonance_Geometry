# Resonance Geometry Axioms

The axioms below capture the philosophical grounding for the Resonance Geometry program. They summarize how oscillatory systems, geometric plasticity, and phenomenology interleave to describe adaptive intelligence.

1. **Axiom 1 — Resonance Precedes Structure.** Coupled oscillators organize before static topology emerges.
2. **Axiom 2 — Plasticity Conserves Phase.** Learning rules preserve relative phase relationships even as amplitudes adapt.
3. **Axiom 3 — Emotion Is Curvature.** Affective dynamics correspond to curvature in the phase-connection bundle.
4. **Axiom 4 — Collapse Requires Coherence.** Transitions between macroscopic attractors occur only when coherence budgets exceed a critical threshold.
