% Preface: From Metaphor to Measurement
This whitepaper operationalizes the RG/GP stance. The philosophy is simple—
form is frozen resonance; memory is holonomy; objectivity is redundancy—
and the engineering is concrete: detect ringing with a PSD peak and overshoots,
measure hysteresis area vs. period, and classify motifs via PR/Gini/Laplacian.
If a claim cannot survive those plots, it does not belong in the core.
(See docs/philosophy/RG_GP_Preface.md for context.)
