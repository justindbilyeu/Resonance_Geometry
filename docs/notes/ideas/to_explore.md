## Low Priority / Speculative (2026+)

### 8. Biological Neural Coding
**Idea**: Does RG framework apply to neuroscience?
- Neural manifolds, representational geometry
- Phase transitions in perception/memory

**Why**: Foundational science, interdisciplinary
**Effort**: Very High (requires neuroscience collaboration)
**Dependencies**: Framework mature

### 9. Topological Data Analysis Integration
**Idea**: Combine RG with TDA (persistent homology, mapper)
- Topological features as phase transition signatures

**Why**: Mathematically elegant
**Effort**: High (learn TDA deeply)
**Dependencies**: Geometric foundation solid

---

### 10. Hardware Acceleration (ITPU)
**Idea**: Custom silicon for information-theoretic operations
- MI/entropy accelerators
- Geometric plasticity controllers

**Why**: Scaling, practical impact
**Effort**: Very High (years, need hardware expertise)
**Dependencies**: Software framework validated
**Note**: See `hardware/ITPU.md`

---

### 11. Gauge-Aware Training
**Idea**: Add Œæùí¢ term to loss function during training
- Train models that "know what they don't know"
- Meta-awareness of representational freedom

**Why**: Proactive solution, not just detection
**Effort**: High (months of training experiments)
**Dependencies**: Theory validated, compute resources

---

### 12. Philosophical Implications
**Idea**: What does geometric phase transition tell us about:
- Nature of understanding vs hallucination
- Consciousness and coherence
- Limits of AI systems

**Why**: Broader impact, interdisciplinary dialogue
**Effort**: Low (writing)
**Dependencies**: Empirical results solid

## Wild Ideas (Maybe Never)

### 13. Social Dynamics as Resonance
**Idea**: Memes, echo chambers, consensus as geometric phase transitions

**Why**: Fun, provocative
**Effort**: ??? (needs social science validation)
**Status**: Pure speculation

---

### 14. Economic Networks
**Idea**: Financial contagion, market crashes as curvature instabilities

**Why**: High-impact application
**Effort**: Very High (need economics background)
**Status**: Interesting analogy, unclear rigor

### 15. Music Theory Connection
**Idea**: Musical consonance/dissonance as literal resonance geometry

**Why**: Beautiful if true
**Effort**: Medium (literature exists)
**Status**: Metaphor or mechanism? Unclear
