# Research Log: Q1 2025 (January - March)

## Overview
Focus for this quarter: Repository organization, empirical validation of hallucination theory, ArXiv submission.

## January 2025

### Week of January 13-19 (W03)

**Goals set**:
- [ ] Organize repository for PhD structure
- [ ] Complete ArXiv v1 of hallucination paper
- [ ] Begin empirical validation protocol

**Accomplished**:
- [x] Discussed PhD trajectory and organization with Claude
- [x] Identified two research programs (GP and hallucination)
- [x] Decided on repo reorganization plan
- [ ] Generated CODEX instructions for reorganization

**Key Insights**:
- Hallucination work is ready for public release
- Need explicit navigation between GP (general) and hallucination (application)
- Multi-model collaboration should be highlighted as methodological innovation
- Repository structure should support PhD dissertation writing

**Decisions Made**:
- Use symmetric normalized Laplacian (L_sym) for curvature proxy
- Temperature/top-k intervention for v1, save RAG for v2
- Emphasize "work in progress" framing for ArXiv
- Create dissertation directory with chapter outlines
- Add methodology and epistemic status sections to paper

**Blockers / Questions**:
- Need to determine relationship between GP and hallucination (special case vs parallel application)
- Code currently in two hierarchies (`src/` and `rg/`) needs unification
- Figures scattered across directories

**Next Actions**:
- [ ] Execute CODEX reorganization instructions
- [ ] Update main README with both research programs
- [ ] Create dissertation outline
- [ ] Add epistemic status and methodology to neurips paper
- [ ] Set up research log structure

**Hours**: ~25 (planning 10, discussion 10, writing 5)

### Week of January 20-26 (W04)

**Goals** (TBD):

## Open Questions for Q1

### Theoretical
- [ ] How exactly does hallucination theory relate to general GP framework?
- [ ] Should we unify the formalisms or keep them separate?
- [ ] What other failure modes could this framework explain?

### Empirical
- [ ] Which curvature proxy performs best (Laplacian, Ollivier-Ricci, Forman)?
- [ ] What's the optimal k for k-NN graphs?
- [ ] Does Î»_max generalize across different model architectures?

### Organizational
- [ ] Best way to structure code (monorepo vs multiple repos)?
- [ ] How to document AI collaboration transparently?
- [ ] How to maintain momentum across multiple threads?
