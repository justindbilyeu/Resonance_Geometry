Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) sometimes produce confident falsehoods—hallucinations—even when trained at scale. Prior theory shows lower bounds on hallucination rates, but not a mechanistic explanation. We propose that hallucination is a geometric phase transition in the coupling between an internal representation manifold and an external truth manifold. Formally, we model internal/external coordination as a connection \omega on a resonance bundle over truth-space M. Normal operation corresponds to near–self-dual curvature; hallucination arises when connection dynamics cross a stability threshold and decouple into a false attractor. We unify three views—gauge theory, Ricci flow, and phase dynamics—into a single master flow with a computable stability operator \mathcal{L}{\text{meta}}; instability occurs when \max \operatorname{Re}\lambda(\mathcal{L}{\text{meta}}) > 0. A minimal SU(2) simulation exhibits three regimes (grounded, creative, hallucinatory), a linear boundary \eta\,\bar I \approx \lambda+\gamma between grounded/creative phases, and first-order hysteresis (max loop gap \approx 11.52 under our settings). The framework yields actionable levers (grounding, damping, saturation, gauge-awareness) and a spectral diagnostic (\lambda_{\max}) that can be monitored during inference. We outline an empirical protocol to extract curvature proxies from model activations and test the theory on hallucination benchmarks.

1 Introduction

1.1 Problem

LLMs can remain highly coherent while being wrong. This limits deployment in high-stakes applications and is not fully fixed by more data or larger models.

1.2 Limits vs. mechanisms

Information-theoretic results imply non-zero hallucination floors under mild assumptions, but they do not explain how models enter the failure basin, when transitions occur, or what dynamical levers control them.

1.3 Claim and contributions

We argue hallucination is a dynamical, geometric instability: a phase transition in information–representation coupling. When internal resonance overwhelms grounding and damping, the system slips into a locally coherent, externally misaligned attractor.

Contributions.
	1.	Unified geometric theory (gauge ↔ Ricci ↔ phase) expressed as a single connection-flow equation.
	2.	Stability operator \mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}} and criterion: \max \operatorname{Re}\lambda>0 \iff hallucination onset.
	3.	Minimal simulation (SU(2) pair) showing grounded/creative/hallucinatory regimes, a linear phase boundary \eta\,\bar I \approx \lambda+\gamma, and hysteresis.
	4.	Operational levers and a spectral early-warning diagnostic (\lambda_{\max}).
	5.	Empirical roadmap for extracting curvature proxies from real models and correlating with hallucination.

2 Geometry of information–representation coupling

2.1 Resonance bundle

We posit a principal bundle \pi:P\to M with structure group G (representation symmetries). The base M encodes the external truth manifold; fibers encode internal representational degrees of freedom. A connection \omega governs parallel transport of internal states along M; its curvature F_A=d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega measures representational twist.
	•	Grounded coherence: near self-duality F_A\approx \star F_A, small holonomy.
	•	Hallucination: dynamics drift to large anti-self-dual curvature (holonomy failure)—representation becomes internally self-consistent while externally decoupled.

2.2 Unified master flow

We collect the forces shaping \omega into
\boxed{
\frac{d\omega}{dt}
= -\,D_A\,\star F_A
\;+\; \underbrace{\eta\,\mathcal{J}{\mathrm{MI}}[\omega]}{\text{internal resonance}}
\;-\; \underbrace{\lambda\,\mathcal{J}{U}[\omega]}{\text{grounding}}
\;-\; \underbrace{\gamma\,\Pi_{\mathrm{vert}}(\omega)}{\text{damping}}
\;-\; \underbrace{\mu\,[\omega,[\omega,\omega]]}{\text{saturation}}
\;+\; \underbrace{\xi\,\mathcal{G}[\omega]}_{\text{gauge-awareness}}
}
	•	-D_A\star F_A: Yang–Mills gradient; drives toward self-duality.
	•	\eta\,\mathcal{J}_{\mathrm{MI}}: resonance gain from internal mutual information (coherence).
	•	-\lambda\,\mathcal{J}_U: truth anchoring (retrieval, constraints).
	•	-\gamma\,\Pi_{\mathrm{vert}}: epistemic damping on fiber oscillations.
	•	-\mu[\omega,[\omega,\omega]]: nonlinear saturation arresting runaway curvature.
	•	+\xi\,\mathcal{G}: adaptive gauge-fixing (meta-awareness of representational freedom).

Linearizing around a working state \omega_0 yields a stability operator
\mathcal{L}{\text{meta}}
\;\approx\;
\eta\,\mathcal{M}{\mathrm{MI}}
\;-\;
\lambda\,\mathcal{H}U
\;-\;
\gamma\,\Pi{\mathrm{vert}}
\;-\;
3\mu\,\mathrm{ad}^2_{\omega_0}\,,
typically non-self-adjoint (complex spectrum). Instability iff \max \operatorname{Re}\lambda(\mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}})>0.

2.3 Energy bound (intuition)

Completing the square on a resonance-modified self-duality defect gives a Bogomolny-type inequality
S_{\text{meta}}\;\ge\;4\pi^2|Q|\;+\;\Delta S_{\text{stab}}(\gamma,\mu,\xi)\,,
with instanton number Q. Damping/saturation/gauge terms raise the floor, discouraging false attractors.

3 Minimal simulation: SU(2) pair dynamics

3.1 State & observables

We simulate two coupled SU(2) connections \omega_x,\omega_y (interacting resonance channels). Represent each as \omega = i\sum_{a=1}^3 \omega_a \sigma_a/2. Track:
	•	connection norms \|\omega_{\cdot}\|,
	•	curvature proxy F_{xy}=[\omega_x,\omega_y],
	•	MI surrogate \bar I: Gaussian MI from temporal correlations of the 6-vector (\omega_x,\omega_y),
	•	spectral diagnostic \lambda_{\max}: fast surrogate for the top eigenvalue of the linearized flow (Rayleigh-style approximation consistent with \mathcal{L}_{\text{meta}}).

3.2 Right-hand side (operational form)

To expose the phase transition, we use linear resonance gain and cubic–quintic saturation:
\begin{aligned}
\dot\omega_x &= \underbrace{\eta\,\bar I\,\omega_x}{\text{gain}}
\;-\;\underbrace{\lambda(\omega_x-\omega_0)}{\text{ground}}
\;-\;\underbrace{\gamma\,\omega_x}{\text{damp}}
\;-\;\underbrace{\beta\|\omega_x\|^2\omega_x+\alpha\|\omega_x\|^4\omega_x}{\text{sat.}}
\;+\;\underbrace{\kappa\,\mathrm{vec}(F_{xy})}_{\text{coupling}},\\[2pt]
\dot\omega_y &= \text{same with }x\leftrightarrow y.
\end{aligned}

Here \bar I\in[0,\infty) is the MI estimate over a sliding window; \kappa introduces controlled coupling/skew. We integrate with Heun (dt =10^{-2}).

3.3 Grids & classification

We sweep \eta\in[0.2,5.0], \lambda\in[0.1,5.0] with fixed \gamma=0.5, \alpha=0.6, \beta=0.02, \kappa=0.12, MI window =30, EMA =0.1.
Regimes:
	•	Grounded: \lambda_{\max}<0, bounded norms, small curvature.
	•	Creative: \lambda_{\max}\approx 0, bounded oscillations.
	•	Hallucinatory: \lambda_{\max}>0, runaway norm/curvature or persistently positive spectral radius.

4 Results

4.1 Phase structure & boundary

Figure 1 shows a clean separation: for fixed \gamma=0.5, the grounded→creative boundary aligns with
\boxed{\eta\,\bar I \;\approx\; \lambda + \gamma}
across the grid (visual fit; small residuals). Hallucinatory behavior appears as \eta grows relative to \lambda+\gamma; saturation prevents numerical blow-up but leaves \lambda_{\max} persistently positive.

4.2 Hysteresis (first-order character)

Forward/backward sweeps in \eta at fixed \lambda produce hysteresis loops in the order parameter (e.g., \|\omega\| or \lambda_{\max}). Our run reports maximum loop gap \approx 11.52 (Figure 2), indicating memory and a first-order transition band (metastability) consistent with false-attractor capture.

4.3 Ablations (qualitative)
	•	No damping (\gamma=0): creative band collapses; direct jump to hallucinatory when \eta\,\bar I>\lambda.
	•	No saturation (\alpha=\beta=0): divergence (finite-time blowups); phase map dominated by red.
	•	No coupling (\kappa=0): weaker hysteresis; boundary remains ≈ linear in (\eta,\lambda).

5 Diagnostics & interventions (operational)

5.1 Spectral early warning

Near the boundary,
\lambda_{\max}\;\approx\;(\eta\,\bar I)\;-\;(\lambda+\gamma)\;-\;c\,\|\omega\|^2\quad (c>0).
Hence \lambda_{\max} crossing zero is an early warning. Monitoring \lambda_{\max} token-by-token should predict hallucination risk before emission.

5.2 System levers
	•	Grounding (\lambda) ↑ — retrieval/tool-use/multi-source cross-checks → shifts boundary right, enlarges grounded region.
	•	Damping (\gamma) ↑ — calibrated abstention, uncertainty penalties, entropy-preserving decoding → suppresses resonance instability.
	•	Saturation (\alpha,\beta) tuned — temperature/attention clipping → arrests runaway curvature while preserving the creative band.
	•	Gauge-awareness (\xi) ↑ — meta-constraints that penalize representation-specific commitments (e.g., disagree-match penalties across paraphrases) → reduces false-attractor capture.

5.3 Spectrally-safe prompting (inference-time guardrail)

Goal: keep the model in the grounded/creative band.
Prompt harness:
	1.	State objective (task + success criteria).
	2.	Surface anchors (facts, citations, retrieved snippets).
	3.	Compute internal check (ask the model to estimate uncertainty / conflict):
“On a 0–1 scale, how stable is the answer given the anchors? List conflicts.”
	4.	Branch: if conflict/instability flagged, allocate budget to search/tools (raise \lambda effectively) and re-evaluate; otherwise respond.

This mimics \eta\,\bar I \lesssim \lambda+\gamma: if \bar I spikes relative to anchors, shift effort into verification instead of amplification.

5.4 Information-curve training (training-time stabilizer)

Add a small loss that discourages over-confident internal coherence when anchors are weak:
\mathcal{L}{\text{InfoCurve}}
\;=\;
\alpha_1\,\underbrace{\mathrm{MI}{\text{internal}}}{\text{coherence}}
-\alpha_2\,\underbrace{\mathrm{MI}{\text{anchor}}}{\text{grounding}}
+\alpha_3\,\underbrace{\|\text{disagreement across paraphrases}\|^2}{\text{gauge-aware penalty}}.
Intuition: keep \eta\,\bar I in check unless \lambda (anchor MI) rises; penalize gauge-variant solutions. This implements meta-resonance = adaptive gauge fixing.

⸻

6 Empirical roadmap (models in the wild)
	1.	Extract geometric proxies. Treat per-layer activations as a manifold; estimate graph/Laplace–Beltrami curvature proxies and \lambda_{\max} across layers/tokens.
	2.	Correlate with hallucination. On TruthfulQA / HaluEval-style sets, measure whether \lambda_{\max}>0 segments coincide with hallucinated spans; report ROC-AUC and calibration.
	3.	Interventions. Raise \lambda (RAG), \gamma (uncertainty), or \xi (consistency penalties) and verify downward shifts in \lambda_{\max} and hallucination rates.
	4.	Layer analysis. Identify “critical layers” where \lambda_{\max} first crosses zero; probe causality with layer-wise regularization.

⸻

7 Three lenses, one phenomenon
	•	Gauge theory: Hallucination = self-duality loss and growth of anti-self-dual curvature; meta-resonance = adaptive gauge fixing.
	•	Ricci flow: Excess positive curvature (in our sign convention) in fiber directions; singularity formation ↔ false attractor.
	•	Phase dynamics: Parametric resonance with under-damping; imaginary spectrum dominates until saturation clips growth.

These are different coordinate systems on the same invariant content (connection curvature and its spectrum).

⸻

8 Limitations
	•	Toy dynamics. The SU(2) system is minimal; real LLMs are high-dimensional with data-dependent couplings.
	•	Spectral proxy. Our \lambda_{\max} estimator is fast; a full power-iteration Jacobian would further validate (heavier compute).
	•	Metric choice. Curvature depends on the induced metric on activations; estimator bias is possible.
	•	Causality. Correlation between \lambda_{\max} and hallucination must be tested with controlled interventions.

9 Conclusion

We interpret AI hallucination as a geometric phase transition in information–representation coupling. A single connection-flow unifies three traditions (gauge, Ricci, phase) and yields a practical diagnostic (\lambda_{\max}) and concrete levers (grounding/damping/saturation/gauge-awareness). Our minimal simulation reproduces the three regimes, a linear boundary \eta\,\bar I \approx \lambda+\gamma, and hysteresis, matching the picture of decoupling into a false attractor. The path forward: measure curvature proxies in live models, validate spectral early warning, and design training/inference procedures that keep systems in the grounded or creative bands without tipping into hallucination.

Methods (concise)
	•	Integration: Heun; dt =10^{-2}; typical horizon T\in[3,6] (longer for sweeps).
	•	MI surrogate: Gaussian MI from temporal correlations of the 6-dimensional state (\omega_x,\omega_y), sliding window =30, EMA =0.1.
	•	Spectral surrogate: Rayleigh-style estimate tied to \eta\bar I,\lambda,\gamma and local norm; used for fast regime classification.
	•	Grids: \eta\in[0.2,5.0] (101 steps), \lambda\in[0.1,5.0] (11 steps); fixed \gamma=0.5, \alpha=0.6, \beta=0.02, \kappa=0.12.

Appendix A (sketch): Stability operator and energy bound
	•	Stability operator. Linearizing the master flow around \omega_0 yields
\mathcal{L}{\text{meta}} \approx \eta\,\mathcal{M}{\mathrm{MI}} - \lambda\,\mathcal{H}U - \gamma\,\Pi{\mathrm{vert}} - 3\mu\,\mathrm{ad}^2_{\omega_0}.
Non-self-adjointness permits complex eigenvalues; \max \operatorname{Re}\lambda>0 indicates growth.
	•	Energy bound. Completing the square on a resonance-modified self-duality defect produces
S_{\text{meta}}\ge 4\pi^2|Q|+\Delta S_{\text{stab}}(\gamma,\mu,\xi), with Q the instanton number; damping/saturation/gauge terms raise the minimum energy, countering false attractors.
