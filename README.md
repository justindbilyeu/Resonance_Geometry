# Resonance Geometry (RG) & Geometric Plasticity (GP)

> "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." â€” *Genesis 1:3*

Resonance Geometry began as a felt sense that rhythms could hold shapeâ€”intuition first, equations later. This repository maps that origin story into math you can inspect, simulations you can rerun, and experiments you can challenge.

### Whatâ€™s Inside

| Track | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **Genesis** | Foundational mythos and narrative arc in the [Genesis prelude](docs/philosophy/Genesis.md). |
| **Codex** | Formal commitments distilled in the [Resonance Axioms](docs/philosophy/Axioms.md). |
| **Equations** | Project-wide drivers and constraints in the [Project Prompt](docs/PROJECT_PROMPT.md). |
| **Sims** | Gradient-flow experiments starting from [`gp_ringing_demo.py`](experiments/gp_ringing_demo.py). |
| **Figures** | Generated artifacts catalogued under [`figures/`](figures/) with context in the [epistemic status ledger](docs/EPistemic_Status.md). |
| **History** | Provenance trail curated in the [History ledger](docs/history/HISTORY.md). |

> **Resonant Check**
> - **Clarity** â€” plain-language overview matched with direct links to the governing documents.
> - **Coherence** â€” philosophy, axioms, and experiments harmonized through the gradient-flow variational potential.
> - **Buildability** â€” editable install path, reproducible tests, and a smoke demo you can run today.

### Quick Run

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
pytest
python experiments/gp_ringing_demo.py --smoke
```

Step into the living latticeâ€”tune, test, and extend the resonance.

## Framework Overview

Biological and artificial systems continuously rewire their internal connections to improve functionâ€”neurons synchronize, modules emerge, and signals find efficient pathways. **Geometric Plasticity (GP)** provides a testable mathematical model for this process, where a networkâ€™s coupling geometry `g` evolves to align with actual information flow `Äª`, while being constrained by complexity, modularity, and fidelity.

The framework centers around a variational potential `V(g; Äª)`:

```
V(g; Äª) = -Äªáµ€g + (Î»/2)â€–gâ€–Â² + (Î²/2)gáµ€Lg + (A/2)â€–Äª - I(g,t)â€–Â²
```

governed by gradient-flow dynamics `Ä¡ = -Î·âˆ‡gV`. Here:

- `I(g,t)` is measured information (e.g., windowed mutual information)
- `L` is a Laplacian encouraging smooth or modular structure
- `Î», Î², A` control penalties for complexity, structure, and tracking fidelity

This repository focuses on empirical predictions and reproducible experimentsâ€”bridging theory with measurable dynamics.

## Current Status (September 2025)

- âœ… **Pre-registered prediction P1:** Demonstrated threshold-triggered rise in alpha-band mutual information and hysteresis under parameter sweeps
- âœ… **Functional synthetic demo:** `gp_ringing_demo.py` generates time-series, hysteresis curves, and structured results
- âœ… **Rigor-enforced testing:** Fixed parameters, seeded RNG, surrogate testing, and multiple-comparisons correction
- ðŸ§ª **Next step:** Replication on small EEG datasets using a locked analysis protocol

*Note: Earlier cosmological analogies are deprecated. Focus is on the GP variational principle and measurable dynamics.*

## Experimental Rigor

This project emphasizes reproducibility and falsifiability:

- **Locked analysis parameters:** Pre-registered window sizes, frequency bands, and estimators
- **Surrogate testing:** Using IAAFT/AR null models to preserve temporal structure
- **Multiple-comparisons control:** Corrected significance testing
- **Blinding & publish-on-fail:** Predefined success criteria and avoidance of p-hacking

**Pre-registration plan:** [`docs/codex/policies/prereg_P1.md`](docs/codex/policies/prereg_P1.md)

## ITPU Integration

This project leverages the [Information-Theoretic Processing Unit (ITPU)](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/ITPU) for high-performance estimation of mutual information, transfer entropy, and other information dynamics. Python reference implementations are provided, with future support for real-time ITPU hardware acceleration.

## Repository Lineage

This canonical hub intentionally preserves the provenance of three legacy efforts:

- [`REAL`](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/REAL)
- [`Geometric-Plasticity-`](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/Geometric-Plasticity-)
- [`ResonanceGeometry`](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/ResonanceGeometry)

The `/archive/` directory houses frozen snapshots (or placeholders when network access is unavailable) for each source. Provenance, deduplication notes, and follow-up actions are tracked in [`docs/history/HISTORY.md`](docs/history/HISTORY.md).

For a guided tour of the merged documentation set, start with [`docs/README_bundle.md`](docs/README_bundle.md) and the epistemic-status context in [`docs/Epistemic_Status_Box.md`](docs/Epistemic_Status_Box.md).
