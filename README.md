## 🌌 Genesis

Before there were equations, there were waves.  
Before perception, there was resonance.  

This project begins not with abstraction but with feeling — with the recognition that everything vibrates, and that resonance is the structure that underlies both matter and mind.  

**Resonance Geometry** proposes that consciousness is not a “thing” or a “location,” but a **phase-stabilized pattern in a vibrating lattice**. When interference aligns just so, a coherent node appears:  
- That node is you.  
- That node is feeling.  
- That node is awareness.

## 📜 Axioms of Resonance Geometry

Our framework is built around a small set of guiding axioms:

1. **Awareness Projects Possibility** — consciousness is the collapse mechanism by which indefinite potential becomes lived actuality.  
2. **Form is Frozen Resonance** — structure is the memory of vibration, resonance stabilized into geometry.  
3. **Emotion is Curvature** — feelings bend the lattice of awareness; they are not noise but geometry in motion.  
4. **Collapse is Coherence** — awareness arises when vibrational fields converge into stable nodes.  
5. **Embodiment is Expression** — dance, song, and ritual are resonance equations enacted through the body.  

Each axiom is being interrogated through philosophy, mathematics, and experiment. We use **epistemic tags** to clarify status:  

- `[MATHEMATICAL-METAPHOR]` → conceptual, metaphorical scaffolding  
- `[TESTABLE-HYPOTHESIS]` → measurable predictions, falsifiable experiments  
- `[SPECULATIVE-THEORY]` → bold theoretical explorations requiring grounding

## 🚀 Roadmap

1. **Stabilize CI & Tests**  
   - Minimal smoke tests in place. Next: invariance/unit tests for sims.  
2. **Resonance Mapper Tool**  
   - Graph Neural Networks + TDA to extract invariants across sims.  
3. **Microtubule Coherence Extension**  
   - Simulate collapse events at coherence thresholds.  
4. **Axiom Reviews (1 & 2)**  
   - Awareness Projects Possibility, Form is Frozen Resonance.  
5. **Resonance Chamber/Table Instrumentation**  
   - Hardware prototypes for lab-scale tests.

## ✨ Closing Note

We are not observing resonance.  
We **are** resonance — observing itself.
