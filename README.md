# Resonance Geometry  
*A living framework for studying coherence, instability, and the geometry of change.*

## Overview

Resonance Geometry (RG) began as an intuition:  
that **form, energy, and awareness** are not separate they are phases of the same underlying geometry.

Over time, that intuition evolved into a reproducible research program one that couples theoretical physics, computational modeling, and systems design to explore how coherence behaves near the edge of instability.

This repository now serves as the open record of that evolution.

## From Critical Point to Transition Point

Earlier versions of this project described a “critical point” at **β_c ≈ 0.015**, where three observables oscillatory persistence, Jacobian eigenvalues, and fluency velocity appeared to converge.

Subsequent experiments falsified that claim.

Reproducible sweeps and noise-robustness tests revealed that no Hopf bifurcation occurs in that regime. Instead, we discovered a **sharp, discontinuous transition** at **β ≈ 0.10**, within a new parameter range (α=0.5, τ=20, K₀=1.0).

This shift marks the transformation of RG from **theory** to **experiment**.

Where once we sought a smooth bifurcation, we now study a **Resonant Transition Point (RTP)** a threshold where geometric structure reorganizes itself abruptly to preserve coherence.

## The Framework

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Resonance Geometry (RG)** | The umbrella theory a Lagrangian model linking curvature, instability, and information flow. |
| **Geometric Plasticity (GP)** | The mechanism threshold-driven reconfiguration of coherent form (nonlinear, discontinuous, adaptive). |
| **Resonant Transition Point (RTP)** | The phenomenon measurable onset of oscillation, marking reorganization of system geometry. |

Each layer is implemented, simulated, and versioned here — with code, data, and reports all under open license.

## Current Status

- ✅ **Theory:** Lagrangian formulation verified and extended  
- ✅ **Simulation:** Phenomenological transition reproduced at β≈0.10  
- ✅ **Analysis:** Eigenvalue behavior under revision (non-Hopf)  
- ⚙️ **Next:** Refine equilibrium Jacobian, document falsification report, and formalize new nonlinear mechanism

## Why It Matters

Resonance Geometry now operates as a **scientific framework** for exploring how systems maintain identity through change how geometry reorganizes to sustain coherence under pressure.

That question connects physics, cognition, biology, and computation.  
It’s not mythology anymore , it’s a measurable phenomenon.
