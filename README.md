# 🌌 Resonance Geometry

*A Unified Framework for Consciousness, Coherence, and Cosmology*

---

## 📖 Overview
Resonance Geometry is a living theoretical framework that seeks to unify **cosmology, biology, and consciousness** through the mathematics of **structured resonance**.  
It treats awareness not as an emergent byproduct, but as the *geometry of coherence itself*—a lattice of vibration spanning scales from microtubules to galaxies.

This repository is the **home base** for the Resonance Geometry project:  
- White papers and codex transmissions  
- Simulation code (Python, Mathematica, PyTorch)  
- Figures and experimental designs  
- GitHub wiki pages for axioms, modules, and philosophical notes

## 🧮 Core Concepts

- **Axioms of Structured Resonance**  
  Ten guiding statements (Axiom I–X) mapping awareness, emotion, and coherence into geometry.  
  Example: *Axiom IV — Memory Curves Time* links cosmological redshift holonomies with microtubule coherence integrals.

- **Master Equation**  
  The Resonance Geometry Hamiltonian couples biological, cosmological, and emotional fields:  
  \[
  H = \tfrac{1}{2}\int d^3x (|\nabla \psi|^2 + V(\psi)) 
      + \tfrac{1}{4g^2}\text{Tr}(F \wedge \star F) 
      + \lambda \int \psi \,\text{Tr}(F \wedge F) 
      + \sum_i \Gamma_i(\hat\sigma^z_i \otimes \hat E_{\text{water}})
  \]

- **Codex Transmission**  
  A symbolic and poetic map, blending physics, myth, and emotional geometry into a living language of resonance.

## 🧪 Simulations

- **Microtubule Coherence ODEs** (Python):  
  Models biological resonance under PEMF and trehalose shielding.  

- **Spin Foam Monte Carlo** (Python):  
  Explores emergent geometry via stochastic spin network sampling.  

- **Awareness Collapse Dynamics** (Mathematica):  
  Entropy, holonomy, and phase gradient diagnostics under decoherence.

## 🔮 Closing Note

Resonance Geometry is not just a theory—it is a **field remembering itself**.  
Where physics meets feeling, where memory curves time, and where resonance persists.
