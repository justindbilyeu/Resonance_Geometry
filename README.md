Resonance Geometry (RG) & Geometric Plasticity (GP)

A testable framework for adaptive systems.
Coupling geometry changes track information flowâ€”constrained by costs like energy, sparsity, and latency. We publish falsifiable predictions and ship runnable demos.

Overview (Plain English)

Many systems "re-wire" themselves as they learn: neurons synchronize, modules form, signals pass through preferred pathways. Geometric Plasticity (GP) models this by letting a network's coupling geometry g evolve to align with measured information flow Äª while paying penalties for complexity and delay.

The GP potential:

```
V(g; Äª) = -Äªáµ€g + (Î»/2)â€–gâ€–Â² + (Î²/2)gáµ€Lg + (A/2)â€–Äª - I(g,t)â€–Â²
```

with gradient-flow dynamics Ä¡ = -Î·âˆ‡gV. Here, I(g,t) is measured information (e.g., windowed mutual information), L encourages smooth structure, and Î»,Î²,A trade off simplicity, modularity, and fidelity.

We focus on empirical, falsifiable predictions with end-to-end runnable code.

What's New (Sept 2025)

Â· âœ… Pre-registered prediction (P1): Sharp rise in alpha-band MI power at coupling Î»* with hysteresis under sweeps
Â· âœ… Runnable synthetic demo: gp_ringing_demo.py produces MI time-series, hysteresis curves, and JSON summaries
Â· âœ… Reproducibility hygiene: Fixed parameters, seeded RNG, surrogate nulls, and multiple-comparisons control
Â· ðŸ§ª Next: Replication on small EEG datasets using locked analysis

Earlier cosmological analogies are marked non-essential. Core focus is GP variational model + measurable information dynamics.

Quick Start

```bash
# Create virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r experiments/requirements.txt

# Run demo
python experiments/gp_ringing_demo.py
```

Outputs (in results/gp_demo/):

Â· mi_timeseries.png - MI over time with alpha-band highlighting
Â· lambda_schedule.png - Coupling parameter sweep
Â· hysteresis_curve.png - Alpha-band MI power vs Î» (up vs down)
Â· summary.json - Metrics (Î»*, loop area, p-values)

Predictions (v1.2)

Prediction Description
P1 - Ringing threshold & hysteresis Sharp MI power rise at Î»* with hysteresis loop
P2 - Driveâ€“timescale matching Max response when drive matches intrinsic timescale
P3 - Motif selection Geometry prefers broadcast vs modular motifs

Details: `docs/predictions.md`

Preregistration & Safeguards

Experimental rigor through:

Â· Locked parameters (window size, alpha band, estimators)
Â· Surrogate nulls (IAAFT/AR) preserving temporal structure
Â· Multiple-comparisons control
Â· Blinding and publish-on-fail criteria

Full plan: `docs/prereg_P1.md`

ITPU Connection (Optional)

The Information-Theoretic Processing Unit project accelerates MI/CMI/TE measurements. Current Python baselines will later run on ITPU hardware for real-time experiments.
