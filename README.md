**A computational framework for adaptive networks that formalizes how systems reshape their internal geometry to optimize information flow.**

-----

## Overview

Biological and artificial systems continuously rewire their internal connections to improve functionâ€”neurons synchronize, modules emerge, and signals find efficient pathways. **Geometric Plasticity (GP)** provides a testable mathematical model for this process, where a networkâ€™s coupling geometry `g` evolves to align with actual information flow `Äª`, while being constrained by complexity, modularity, and fidelity.

The framework centers around a variational potential `V(g; Äª)`:

```
V(g; Äª) = -Äªáµ€g + (Î»/2)â€–gâ€–Â² + (Î²/2)gáµ€Lg + (A/2)â€–Äª - I(g,t)â€–Â²
```

governed by gradient-flow dynamics `Ä¡ = -Î·âˆ‡gV`. Here:

- `I(g,t)` is measured information (e.g., windowed mutual information)
- `L` is a Laplacian encouraging smooth or modular structure
- `Î», Î², A` control penalties for complexity, structure, and tracking fidelity

This repository focuses on empirical predictions and reproducible experimentsâ€”bridging theory with measurable dynamics.

## Current Status (September 2025)

- âœ… **Pre-registered prediction P1:** Demonstrated threshold-triggered rise in alpha-band mutual information and hysteresis under parameter sweeps
- âœ… **Functional synthetic demo:** `gp_ringing_demo.py` generates time-series, hysteresis curves, and structured results
- âœ… **Rigor-enforced testing:** Fixed parameters, seeded RNG, surrogate testing, and multiple-comparisons correction
- ðŸ§ª **Next step:** Replication on small EEG datasets using a locked analysis protocol

*Note: Earlier cosmological analogies are deprecated. Focus is on the GP variational principle and measurable dynamics.*

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/justindbilyeu/Resonance_Geometry
cd Resonance_Geometry

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r experiments/requirements.txt

# Run the core demonstration
python experiments/gp_ringing_demo.py
```

**Outputs** (saved to `results/gp_demo/`):

- `mi_timeseries.png` â€“ Mutual information over time with alpha-band emphasis
- `lambda_schedule.png` â€“ Coupling parameter sweep protocol
- `hysteresis_curve.png` â€“ Alpha-band power vs. Î» (showing hysteresis)
- `summary.json` â€“ Quantitative results (Î»*, loop area, p-values)

## Experimental Rigor

This project emphasizes reproducibility and falsifiability:

- **Locked analysis parameters:** Pre-registered window sizes, frequency bands, and estimators
- **Surrogate testing:** Using IAAFT/AR null models to preserve temporal structure
- **Multiple-comparisons control:** Corrected significance testing
- **Blinding & publish-on-fail:** Predefined success criteria and avoidance of p-hacking

**Pre-registration plan:** [`docs/prereg_P1.md`](docs/prereg_P1.md)

## Repository Lineage

Resonance_Geometry now consolidates work that previously lived in three standalone projects:

- [resonance-geometry-docs](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/resonance-geometry-docs) â€“ long-form whitepapers, preregistrations, and philosophy notes.
- [gp-simulations](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/gp-simulations) â€“ Python prototypes for ringing, hysteresis, and motif sweeps.
- [resonance-figures-archive](https://github.com/justindbilyeu/resonance-figures-archive) â€“ published plots, figure templates, and design assets.

The migration timeline and release notes are tracked in [`docs/history/HISTORY.md`](docs/history/HISTORY.md).
