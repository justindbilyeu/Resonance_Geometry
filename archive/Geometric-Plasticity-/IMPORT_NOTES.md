# Geometric-Plasticity- repository import status

`git subtree add --prefix archive/Geometric-Plasticity- ...` could not reach the upstream repository because outbound HTTPS is blocked (CONNECT tunnel 403). The placeholder persists so the subtree can be added once connectivity is restored. See [`docs/history/HISTORY.md`](../../docs/history/HISTORY.md) for provenance tracking and follow-up actions.
