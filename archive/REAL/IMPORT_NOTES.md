# REAL repository import status

We attempted to import the upstream `REAL` repository history via `git subtree add --prefix archive/REAL ...`, but the sandboxed environment blocks outbound HTTPS connections (CONNECT tunnel 403). As a result, the upstream history could not be fetched automatically. The directory is reserved for a future subtree import once network access is available.
