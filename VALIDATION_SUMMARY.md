# Equilibrium Validation - Complete Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-24  
**Branch:** `claude/validate-wide-hopf-011CUS1BhkHL38bbBdHmTfAu`  
**PR:** https://github.com/justindbilyeu/Resonance_Geometry/pull/106  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - READY TO MERGE**

---

## Mission Accomplished

Successfully validated and integrated PR #105's wide α-sweep claim (Hopf crossing near α≈0.832) while preserving the original finding that the observed RTP at α=0.35 is non-Hopf. All artifacts are reproducible, unit tests assert both claims, and LaTeX snippets are ready for paper integration.

---

## Key Scientific Findings

### 1. Non-Hopf RTP Validated ✅
- **Range:** α ∈ [0.25, 0.55] (61 points, step=0.005)
- **Finding:** All max Re(λ) < 0 (≈ -0.04)
- **Conclusion:** RTP at α=0.35 is **NOT a Hopf bifurcation**

### 2. Conventional Hopf Crossing Found ✅
- **Range:** α ∈ [0.10, 1.00] (91 points, step=0.01)
- **Crossing:** α* ≈ 0.8350
  - Last stable: α = 0.8300, Re(λ) = -0.040
  - First unstable: α = 0.8400, Re(λ) = +0.058
- **Conclusion:** Conventional stability loss via Hopf-like bifurcation

### 3. High-Resolution Crossing ✅
- **Range:** α ∈ [0.80, 0.86] (61 points, step=0.001)
- **Crossing:** α* ≈ 0.833051 ± 0.000508
- **Conclusion:** Precise crossing with sub-milliprecision

### Physical Interpretation

**Two distinct phenomena identified:**

1. **Early (α ≈ 0.35):** Global geometric reorganization (RTP)
   - Occurs while system is stable (Re(λ) < 0)
   - Novel phenomenon distinct from classical bifurcations
   
2. **Late (α ≈ 0.83):** Local linearized instability (Hopf)
   - Classical bifurcation where Re(λ) crosses zero
   - System becomes exponentially unstable

## Test Results

All 3 unit tests pass:

```
✓ Narrow range: all 61 points stable (max Re(λ) < 0)
✓ Wide range: crossing detected at α* ≈ 0.8350
  Last stable: α = 0.8300
  First unstable: α = 0.8400
✓ Zoom range: high-resolution crossing at α* ≈ 0.833051
  Precision: ±0.000508

====== 3 passed in 0.02s ======
```

## Merge Conflict Resolution

**Issue:** Both PR #105 and PR #106 modified wide sweep data files with different step sizes.

**Resolution:**
- Kept PR #106 version (step=0.01, 91 points)
- Matches explicit config: `configs/equilibrium_sweep.yaml`
- All unit tests pass with resolved data
- Narrow/zoom sweeps unaffected

**Merge commit:** `fd9dfa6`

## Reproducibility

### Quick Start
```bash
make sweep-narrow   # Generate narrow sweep (2s)
make sweep-wide     # Generate wide sweep (3s)
make sweep-zoom     # Generate zoom sweep (2s)
python -m pytest tests/test_eigs_assertions.py -v  # Run tests
```

### Parameters (from config)
- seed: 42 (deterministic)
- K0: 1.2 (drive)
- gamma: 0.08 (damping)
- omega0_sq: 1.0 (natural frequency²)
